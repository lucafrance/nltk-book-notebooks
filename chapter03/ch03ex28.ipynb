    "Consider the numeric expressions in the following sentence from the MedLine Corpus: *The corresponding free cortisol fractions in these sera were 4.53 +/- 0.15% and 8.16 +/- 0.23%, respectively*. Should we say that the numeric expression *4.53 +/- 0.15%* is three words? Or should we say that it's a single compound word? Or should we say that it is actually *nine* words, since it's read \"four point five three, plus or minus zero point fifteen percent\"? Or should we say that it's not a \"real\" word at all, since it wouldn't appear in any dictionary? Discuss these different possibilities. Can you think of application domains that motivate at least two of these answers?"
