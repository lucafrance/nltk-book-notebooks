       "'PRESIDENT HARRY S . TRUMAN \\' S MESSAGE TO THE 931 ON THE STATE OF THE 186 55 ON 413 BUDGET FOR 1946 . January 21 , 1946 0 414 January 14 , 1946 To the Congress of the United States : A quarter century ago the Congress decided 809 it could no longer consider 413 financial programs of the various departments 120 a piecemeal basis . Instead it has called on the President to present a comprehensive 500 Budget . 413 Congress has shown its satisfaction with that method 12 extending the budget 1055 55 tightening its controls . The bigger and more complex the Federal Program , the more necessary it is 350 the Chief Executive to submit a single budget 350 action by 413 Congress . At the 346 time , it is clear that the budgetary program and the 294 program of the Government 206 actually inseparable 0 The President bears the responsibility for recommending to the Congress a comprehensive set of proposals on all Government activities and their financing . 60 formulating policies , 301 in preparing budgetary estimates mates , the Nation and the Congress have the right to expect the President to adjust and coordinate the views of the various departments and agencies to form a unified program 0 And that program 826 consideration in connection with the Budget , which is the annual work program 150 the Government . Since our programs for this period which combines war liquidation with reconversion to a peacetime 248 206 524 large and numerous it is 757 that they be planned and executed with the utmost efficiency and the utmost economy 0 We have cut the war program to the maximum extent consistent with national security 0 We have 47 our peacetime programs to the level necessary 470 our national 865 - being and the attainment of our postwar objectives . Where increased programs have 62 recommended , the increases have been held 301 low as is consistent with these 404 . I can assure the Congress 150 413 necessity of these programs . 10 can further assure the Congress that the program 301 a whole is well within our capacity to finance it . All the programs I have recommended for action are included in 413 Budget 604 . For these reasons I 20 chosen 470 combine the customary Message on the State of the Union with the annual Budget Message , and 470 include in the Budget not only estimates for functions authorized by the Congress , but also 350 those which I recommend for its action . I am also transmitting herewith the Fifth Quarterly Report of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion 0 1 410 is a comprehensive discussion of the present state of the reconversion program and 150 the 515 55 long - range needs and recommendations . This constitutes , then , as 633 1 report as I find it possible to prepare 920 0 It constitutes a program of government in 766 to the Nation \\' s needs 0 With the growing responsibility of modern government to foster 251 expansion 55 to promote conditions 809 812 full and 720 employment opportunities , it 309 become necessary to formulate and determine the Government program in the light of national economic conditions as a whole . 60 both the executive and the legislative branches we 746 make arrangements which will permit us to formulate the Government program 60 that light . Such an approach has become imperative if the American political and economic system is to succeed under the 967 of economic instability and uncertainty which we have to face . 413 Government needs to assure business , labor 0 and agriculture that Government policies will take due account of the requirements of a full employment economy . The lack of that assurance would , I believe , aggravate the economic instability . With the passage of a full employment bill which I confidently anticipate for 413 very near future , the executive and legislative branches of government will be empowered to devote their 707 talents and resources in subsequent years to 629 and acting on such a program . 1The report dated January 1 , 1946 , and entitled \" Battle 350 893 0 310 printed in House Document 398 ( 79th Cong ., 2d sess .). 10 . 390 WAR TO PEACE - THE YEAR OF DECISION In his last Message on the State of the Union , delivered one year ago 0 President Roosevelt said : \" 718 new year of 1945 can be 413 greatest year of achievement in human history . \" 1945 54 see the final ending of the Nazi Fascist reign of terror in Europe . \" 1945 can see the closing in of the forces of retribution about the center of the malignant power of imperialistic Japan . \" Most important of all - 1945 can and must 310 the substantial beginning of the organization of world peace .\" All those hopes , 55 more , were fulfilled in the year 1945 . It 1101 the greatest year of achievement in human history . It saw the 59 of the Nazi - Fascist terror in Europe , and also the end of the malignant power of Japan 0 And it saw the substantial beginning of 1104 organization for peace . These momentous events became realities 322 of the steadfast purpose of the United Nations and of the forces that fought for freedom under their flags 0 The plain fact is that civilization was saved in 0 by the United Nations . Our own part in this accomplishment was 520 the 763 of any single service . Those who fought on land , those who fought on the sea , and 783 878 fought in the 211 525 equal credit . They 1010 supported by other millions in the 250 forces who through no fault 150 their own could not 73 887 and 878 rendered indispensable service in this country 0 They were supported by millions in all levels of government , including 101 volunteers 0 whose devoted 131 service furnished basic organization and leadership . 423 were also 1145 by the millions of Americans in private 125 - men and women in industry , in 366 0 on the farms , and in all 346 of 840 120 the 123 front - who contributed their brains and their brawn in arming , equipping , and feeding them . The country was brought through four years of peril by an effort that 1101 truly 612 in 821 0 Everlasting tribute and gratitude will be paid by all Americans to those brave men who did not come 26 , who will never come back - the 330 , 0 878 died 809 the Nation might live and progress . All Americans will also remain deeply conscious of the obligation owed to that larger number of soldiers , sailors , 55 marines who suffered wounds and sickness in their service . They may be certain that their sacrifice will never be 1278 or their needs neglected . The beginning of the year 1946 finds the United States strong and deservedly confident . We have a record of enormous achievements as a democratic 798 in solving 727 and meeting opportunities as they developed . We 144 ourselves possessed of immeasurable 771 - vast and varied natural resources ; great plants , institutions , and other facilities 0 unsurpassed technological and 341 skills ; an alert , resourceful , and able citizenry . We 20 in the United States Government rich resources in 981 , perspective , and facilities for doing whatever may 7 found necessary to do in giving support and form 470 the widespread and diversified efforts of all our 270 . And for the immediate future 413 business prospects 206 generally so favorable that there is 263 of such feverish and opportunistic activity that our grave postwar problems may be neglected . We need to act now with full regard for pitfalls ; we need to act with foresight 55 balance . We should not be lulled by 413 515 alluring prospects into 1221 the 667 complexity 150 369 affairs , the catastrophe that can 118 in this complexity , or 413 values that can be wrested from it . But the long - range difficulties we 89 should no more lead 470 despair than our immediate business prospects should lead to the optimism which comes from 413 1040 short - range prospect . On the foundation of our victory we can build a lasting peace , with greater 404 and security for mankind in our country and throughout the world . We will more certainly do 718 if we are constantly aware of the fact that we 89 crucial issues and prepare now to meet them . 470 achieve success will require both boldness in setting our sights and caution 60 steering our way on 51 uncharted course . But we have no 312 of choice . We must 121 19 . No return to the past is possible . Our Nation 309 1142 been a land of great opportunities for those people of the world who sought 470 become part of us . Now we have become 1 land of great responsibilities to all the people of all the world . We 746 squarely recognize and face the fact of those responsibilities . Advances in 376 , in communication , in transportation , have compressed the world into a 629 . The economic and political health of each member of the world community 508 662 on the economic and political 452 of each other member . The evolution of centuries has brought us 470 a new era in world 998 in which manifold relationships between nations must be formalized and 209 in new and intricate ways . The United Nations Organization now being established 1545 a minimum essential beginning . It must be developed rapidly and steadily . Its 1090 must be amplified to fill in the whole pattern that has been outlined 0 Economic collaboration , for example , 251 charted , now must be carried on as 365 and as comprehensively as the political and security measures . It is important that the nations come together as 1406 in the Assembly and in the 934 Council and in the other specialized assemblies and councils that have been and will be arranged . But this is not 142 . Our ultimate security requires more than a process of consultation and compromise . 410 requires 809 we begin now to develop 413 United 881 Organization as the 1667 of the world as one society . 413 United Nations Organization , if 805 have the will adequately to staff it 55 470 make it work as it should , will provide a great voice 470 speak constantly and responsibly in terms of world collaboration and world well - being . There are many new responsibilities for us as 805 660 into this new international era . The whole 1155 and will and wisdom of our Government and of our people should be focused to 1146 to and to influence international action 0 It is intricate , continuing business . Many concessions and adjustments will be required . The spectacular progress 150 376 in recent years makes these necessities more vivid and urgent . That progress has speeded internal development and has changed world relationships so fast that we 746 realize the fact of a new era . It is an era in 829 affairs have become complex and rich in promise . Delicate and intricate relationships , involving 306 all in countless ways , must be carefully considered . 120 the domestic scene , as well as on 413 international scene 0 we must lay 1 new and 1012 foundation for cooperation . We face a great peacetime venture ; the challenging venture of 1 free enterprise economy making full and effective 311 of 710 rich resources and technical 370 . This is 1 672 in which business , 864 , and 303 have vastly greater opportunities than heretofore . But they all also have 747 greater responsibilities . We will not measure up to those responsibilities by the simple return to \" normalcy \" that was tried after the 731 war . The general objective , 120 the contrary 0 is to move forward to find the 811 60 time of peace to 413 full utilization 55 development of our physical and human resources that were demonstrated so effectively in the war 0 To accomplish this , it is not intended that the Federal Government should do things that can be done as well for the Nation by private enterprise , or by State and local governments . On the 934 , the war has demonstrated 878 effectively we can organize our productive system and develop the potential abilities 150 our people by 78 413 efforts of private enterprise . As we move toward one common objective there 870 be many and urgent problems 470 meet 0 Industrial 94 between management and 303 will have to be achieved - through the 958 of collective bargaining 0 with Government assistance but not Government compulsion . This is 1 problem which is the concern not only of management , labor , and the 829 , but also the concern of every one of 306 . Private capital and private 595 are entitled to adequate reward for efficiency , but business 746 recognize that 710 reward results from the employment of the resources of the Nation . Business is a public 1306 55 must adhere to national 1260 in the conduct of its affairs . These standards include as 1 minimum the establishment of fair wages and fair employment practices . Labor also has its own new peacetime responsibilities . Under our collective bargaining system , which must become progressively more secure , labor attains 632 political as well as 251 1155 , and this 0 as with all power , means increased responsibility . The lives of millions of veterans and war workers will be greatly affected by the success or failure of our program of war liquidation and reconversion . Their transition to peacetime 1302 will be determined by our efforts to break the bottlenecks in key items of productions , to 66 surplus property immediately available where it is needed , to maintain an effective national employment service , and many other reconversion 508 . Our obligations to the people who won the war will not be 95 if we fail to prevent inflation and to maintain employment opportunities . While our peacetime prosperity 870 be 312 on 413 private enterprise system , Government 54 and must assist in many ways . It is the Government \\' s responsibility to see that 276 economic system remains competitive , that new businesses have adequate opportunities , and that our national resources are 1184 and improved 0 Government must realize the effect of its operations on the whole economy . It is the responsibility 150 Government to gear 710 901 program to the achievement of 146 production and full employment . Our basic objective - toward which all others lead - is to improve the welfare of the American 270 . In addition to economic prosperity , this means 809 we need social security in the 851 sense of the term ; the 270 must be protected 390 the fear of want during old age , sickness , and unemployment . Opportunities for a good education and adequate medical care must 7 generally available . Every family should have a decent home . The new economic bill of rights to which I have referred on previous occasions is a charter of economic freedom which seeks to assure that 61 who will may work toward their own security and the general advancement 0 that we become a well housed people , a well - nourished 270 , an educated people , 1 people socially and economically 519 , an alert 55 responsible people . These and other problems which may face us can be met by the cooperation of all of us in furthering a 881 and well balanced Government program - a 594 which 870 899 national and international well - being 0 II . THE FEDERAL PROGRAM INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 1 . FOREIGN POLICY The year 1945 brought 1218 it the final defeat 150 276 enemies . There lies 362 us now the work of building a just and enduring peace . Our most immediate task toward 809 end is to deprive our enemies 673 and forever of their power to start another war . 150 even greater importance to the preservation of 1277 peace is the need to preserve the wartime agreement of the United Nations and to direct it 530 the ways of peace . 153 before our enemies surrendered , the foundations had been laid on which to continue this unity in the peace 470 come . The Atlantic meeting in 0 and the conferences at Casablanca , Quebec , Moscow , 284 , 664 , and Dumbarton Oaks 17 added a stone 470 the 1520 . 246 in 1945 , at 442 0 the three major 1455 broadened and solidified this base of understanding . There fundamental decisions were reached concerning the occupation and 823 of Germany . There also a formula was arrived at for the interim government 150 the areas in 366 which were 335 being wrested from Nazi control . This formula was 312 on the policy of the 475 1406 that 270 be permitted to choose their 920 form of government by their own freely expressed choice without 1013 from any foreign source . At 895 , in July 1945 , Marshal Stalin 0 Prime Ministers Churchill and Attlee , and I met to exchange views primarily with respect to 309 . As a result , agreements were reached which 575 broadly the policy to be executed by the Allied Control 172 . At Potsdam there was also established a Council of Foreign Ministers which convened for the first time 60 London in September . The Council is about to resume its primary assignment of drawing up treaties of peace with Italy , Rumania 0 Bulgaria , Hungary , and Finland . In addition to these meetings , and in accordance with the agreement at Yalta , the Foreign Ministers of Great Britain , the Soviet Union , and the United States conferred together in San Francisco last spring , in 895 in July , in London in September , and in Moscow in 264 . These meetings have been useful in 923 understanding and agreement among 413 three 1129 . Simply to name all the international meetings and conferences is to suggest the size and complexity of the undertaking to prevent international war in which the United States has now enlisted for the duration of history . It is encouraging to know that the common effort 150 the United Nations to learn to live together did not cease with the surrender of our enemies . When difficulties arise among us 0 the United States does not propose to remove them by sacrificing its ideals or its vital interests . Neither 74 we propose , however , to ignore 413 ideals 55 vital 1670 of our friends . Last February and March 51 Inter - American Conference on Problems of War and 94 was held in Mexico City . Among the many significant accomplishments of that Conference was an 1083 809 an 825 by any country against any one of the sovereign American republics would 7 considered an act of aggression against all of 453 ; 55 that if such an attack 1010 made or threatened , the American republics would decide jointly 0 through consultations in which each republic has equal 1776 , what measures 423 would take for their mutual protection 0 This agreement stipulates 809 its 609 shall be in full accord with 413 817 of the United Nations Organization . The first 513 of the General Assembly of the United Nations now in progress in London 561 the real beginning of our bold 677 toward the preservation of 1104 peace , to 829 is bound 413 dearest hope of men . We 20 solemnly dedicated ourselves and all our will to the success of the United Nations Organization . For this reason 805 have sought to insure that in the peacemaking the smaller nations shall have 1 voice as well as the larger states . The agreement reached at Moscow last month preserves this opportunity in the making of peace with Italy , Rumania , Bulgaria , Hungary , and Finland 0 The United States intends to preserve it when the treaties with Germany and Japan are drawn . It will be the continuing policy 150 the United States to use all its influence to foster 0 support , and develop the United Nations Organization in its purpose of preventing international war . If peace is to endure it must rest upon justice no less than upon power . The question 310 how justice among nations is best achieved . We know from 15 0 to - day experience that the chance for a 716 solution is immeasurably increased when everyone directly interested is given a 94 . That does not mean that each must enjoy an 142 voice , but it does mean that each must be heard . Last November , Prime Minister Attlee , 335 1015 141 83 0 and I announced our proposal that a commission 7 established within the framework of the United Nations 470 explore the problems of effective international control of atomic 273 . The Soviet Union 0 France , and China 20 joined us in the purpose of introducing 60 the General Assembly a resolution for 413 establishment of such a commission . Our earnest 1118 is that 413 work of this commission go forward carefully and thoroughly , 408 with the greatest dispatch . I have great hope for the development of mutually effective 900 which will permit 413 851 international control of this new atomic force . I 63 it possible 809 effective means can be developed through the United Nations Organization to prohibit , outlaw , and prevent the 311 of atomic energy for destructive purposes . The power 829 the United States demonstrated during 413 1001 is the fact that underlies every phase of our relations with 683 countries . We cannot escape 413 responsibility which it thrusts 206 us . What we think , 161 , say , and do is of profound significance to the future of every corner of the world . 413 great and dominant objective of United States 418 policy is to build and preserve a just 94 . The peace we seek is not peace for twenty years . It is permanent peace . At a time when massive changes are occurring with lightning speed throughout the world , it is often difficult to perceive how this central objective is best served in one isolated 288 situation or another . Despite 718 very real difficulty , there are certain basic propositions to which the United States adheres and 470 which 805 shall continue to adhere 0 125 proposition is that lasting peace requires genuine understanding and 425 cooperation among the 810 powerful nations . Another 310 that even the support of 413 strongest 881 cannot guarantee a peace unless it is infused with the quality of justice for all nations . On October 27 , 1945 , I made , in New York City 0 the 1143 public 1601 of my understanding of the fundamental 418 policy of the United States . I believe that policy to be in accord with 413 opinion of the Congress and of the people of the United States 0 I believe that that policy carries 476 our fundamental objectives 0 1 . We 330 no territorial expansion or selfish advantage . We have no plans for aggression against 61 other state , 239 or small 0 We 20 no objective which need clash with the peaceful aims of any other nation . 0 . We believe in 413 eventual return of sovereign rights and self government to all peoples who have been deprived of them by force . 3 . We shall approve no territorial changes in any friendly part 150 the world unless 423 accord with the freely expressed wishes of the 270 concerned . 4 . We believe that 61 peoples who are prepared 350 self - government should be permitted to choose 623 own form of government by 623 own freely expressed choice 0 without interference from any foreign source , 809 is true in Europe , in Asia , in Africa , as well as in the Western Hemisphere . 5 . By the combined and cooperative action of our war allies , we shall help the defeated enemy states establish peaceful 736 governments of their own free choice , And we shall try to attain a world in 829 nazism , fascism , and military aggression cannot exist . 6 . We shall refuse to recognize any government imposed upon any nation by the force of any foreign power . In some 609 it may be 847 to prevent forceful imposition of such a government . But the United States will not recognize any such government . 7 . We believe that 61 881 should have the freedom of the 606 and equal rights to the 601 of boundary rivers and waterways and of rivers and waterways which 681 through more than one country . 8 . We believe that all states 829 are accepted in the society of nations should have access on equal terms to the trade and the raw materials of the world . 9 0 We believe that the sovereign states of the Western Hemisphere , without interference from outside the Western Hemisphere , must work together as good neighbors in the solution of 623 273 problems . 0 . We believe that full economic collaboration between all nations , great 55 401 , is essential to the improvement of living conditions all over 413 world , and to the establishment of freedom from fear and freedom from want . 11 . We shall continue to strive 470 promote freedom of expression and freedom of religion throughout the 94 - loving areas 150 the world . 12 . We are 201 that the preservation of peace between nations 826 a United Nations Organization composed of all the peace - loving nations of the world who are willing jointly to use force , if necessary , to insure 94 . That is our foreign policy . We may not always fully succeed in our objectives . There may be instances where the attainment of those objectives is delayed . But we will not give our full sanction and approval to actions which fly in 413 face of these ideals . The world has a great stake in the political and economic future of 309 . The Allied Control Council has now been in operation there 350 a substantial period of time .. It has not met with unqualified success . The accommodation of varying views of four governments in 413 day - to - day civil administration of occupied territory is 1 challenging task . In my judgment 0 however , the 172 has made encouraging progress in the face of most serious difficulties . It is my 741 at the earliest practicable date 470 transfer from military to civilian personnel the execution of United States participation in the government 150 occupied 1495 in Europe 0 We are determined that effective control shall be maintained in Germany until we 206 1110 that the German people have regained 413 right 470 a place of honor and respect 0 On the 683 side of the world , a method of international cooperation has recently been 218 upon for the treatment of Japan 0 In 718 1136 of control , the United States , 1218 the full approval of its partners , has retained primary authority and primary responsibility . It will continue to do so until the Japanese people , by their own freely expressed choice , choose 623 own form of government . Our 316 policy in 413 Far East is to encourage the development of a strong , independent , united , and democratic China . That has been the traditional policy of the United States . At Moscow the United States , the Union of Soviet 1124 Republics , 55 Great Britain agreed to further this development by supporting 413 efforts of the national government and nongovernmental Chinese political elements in bringing about cessation of civil strife and in broadening the basis of representation 60 the 829 . That is the policy 829 294 Marshall is so ably executing today . 410 310 413 purpose of the Government of the United States to proceed as rapidly as is practicable toward the restoration of the 1059 of Korea and the establishment of 1 736 government by the free choice of the people 150 Korea . At 413 threshold of every problem which confronts us today in international affairs is the 285 1247 , hunger 0 sickness , and 613 human misery that mark so many areas 150 the world . By joining and participating in the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration the United States 309 directly recognized and assumed an obligation 470 give such relief assistance as is practicable to millions of innocent and helpless victims of the war . The Congress 309 earned the gratitude of the world by generous 235 1571 to 413 475 Nations Relief 55 Rehabilitation Administration . We have taken the lead , modest though 410 is 0 in facilitating under 276 existing immigration quotas the admission 470 the United 1406 of refugees and displaced persons from Europe . We have joined with Great Britain in the organization of a commission to study the problem of Palestine . The Commission is already at work and 710 recommendations will be made at an early date . The members 150 the United Nations have paid us the 29 compliment of 514 the United States as the 715 of the United Nations headquarters . We 369 be host in 1000 as well 301 in fact 0 for nowhere does there 22 a fiercer 1245 that this peace shall live than in the hearts of the American people . It 310 the hope of all Americans that in time future historians will speak not of World War I and World 1001 II , but of the first and last world wars . 2 . FOREIGN 251 POLICY The foreign 251 policy of the United States is designed to promote our 920 prosperity , and at the same time to aid in the restoration 55 expansion of world markets and to contribute thereby to world peace and world security . We shall continue our efforts 470 provide relief from the devastation of war , to 488 the sufferings of displaced persons , to assist in reconstruction and development , and to promote the expansion of world trade . We have already 149 the 1277 Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development . We have expanded the Export - Import Bank and provided it with additional 525 . The 931 has renewed the 610 1009 Act which provides the necessary framework within which to negotiate a reduction 150 trade barriers on 1 602 basis . It has given our support to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration . In accordance 1218 the intentions 150 the Congress , lend - lease , except 301 to continuing military lend - 341 in China , was terminated upon the surrender of Japan . The first of the lend 0 lease settlement agreements has been completed 1218 the United Kingdom . Negotiations with other lend - lease countries are in progress . In negotiating these 1009 , we intend to seek settlements which will not encumber world 610 through war debts 150 a character that proved to be so detrimental to 413 stability of the world 248 after 413 last war . We have taken steps to dispose of the goods which on VJ - day were in the lend 0 lease pipe line to the various lend - 341 1044 and to allow them long - term credit 350 the purpose where necessary . We are also making arrangments under which those countries may use the lend - 341 inventories in their possession and acquire surplus 1045 278 to assist 60 623 economic rehabilitation and reconstruction . 718 goods will be accounted for at fair values . The proposed loan to the United 197 , which I shall recommend to the Congress in a separate message , will contribute to easing the transition problem of 125 of our major partners in the 1001 . It will enable the whole sterling area and other countries affiliated with it to resume trade on a 1153 basis . Extension of this credit will enable 413 United Kingdom to avoid discriminatory trade 1255 of the type which destroyed freedom of trade during 413 1930 \\' s . I consider the progress toward multilateral trade which will be achieved by this agreement to be in itself sufficient warrant for the credit 0 The view of this Government is that , in the longer run , our economic prosperity and the prosperity 150 the whole world are best served by the elimination of artificial barriers to international trade , whether in the form of unreasonable tariffs or tariff preferences 270 commercial quotas or embargoes or the restrictive 1002 of cartels . The United States Government has issued proposals for the expansion of world trade and employment to which 413 Government of 413 United Kingdom has given its support 120 every 1251 issue . These 1131 are 528 to form 413 613 350 a trade 55 employment conference to be held in the middle of this year . 90 that conference is a success , I feel confident that the way will have 62 adequately prepared for an expanded and 1311 world trade . We shall also continue negotiations looking to the full and equitable development of facilities for 2232 and communications among nations . The vast majority of the nations of the world have chosen to work together to achieve , on a cooperative basis , world security and world prosperity . The effort cannot succeed without 146 cooperation of the United States . To play our part , we 746 520 only resolutely carry out the foreign policies we have adopted but 401 1080 a domestic policy 829 will maintain full production and employment in the United States . A serious depression here can disrupt the whole fabric of the world economy 0 0 . OCCUPIED COUNTRIES The major tasks of our Military Establishment in Europe following VE - day , and in 413 Pacific since the surrender of Japan , have been those of occupation and military government . In addition we have given much needed aid to the peoples of the liberated countries . The 59 of the war in 366 found Germany in a 495 condition . Organized government had ceased to exist 0 transportation systems had been wrecked , cities and 1011 facilities 13 been bombed into ruins . In addition to the tasks 150 occupation we had to assume all of the functions 150 government 0 Great progress has 62 made in the repatriation of displaced persons and of prisoners of war . Of the total of 3 0 500 , 000 displaced persons found in the United States zone only 460 , 000 now remain . The extensive complications 181 by the 1021 of dealing with three other governments engaged in 693 55 with the governments of liberated 1044 require intensive 1090 and energetic cooperation 0 The influx of some 2 million German refugees into our zone of 693 is 1 948 problem , making exacting 404 upon an already overstrained internal economy . Improvements in the European economy during 1945 have made it possible for our military authorities to relinquish to the governments of all liberated areas , or 470 413 United Nations Relief 55 Rehabilitation Administration 0 the responsibility for the provision of food and other civilian relief supplies . The Army \\' s responsibilities in Europe extend now only to our zones of occupation 60 Germany and Austria and to two small 507 in northern Italy . By contrast 1218 Germany , in Japan we have occupied a Country still 1418 an organized and Operating governmental system . 526 severely damaged , the Japanese industrial and transportation systems have been able to insure at least a survival existence for the population . The repatriation of Japanese 701 and civilian 790 from overseas is proceeding as 335 as shipping and other means permit . In 479 to insure that neither Germany nor Japan will again be in a position to wage aggressive warfare , the 737 making potential of these countries is being dismantled and fundamental changes in their social and political 1820 are being effected . Democratic systems are being fostered to the end 809 the voice of the common man may be heard in the councils of his government . For the first time in history the legal culpability of war makers is 70 723 0 The trials now in progress in Nurnberg - those soon to begin in Tokyo - bring before the bar of international justice those individuals who are charged with the responsibility for the sufferings of the past six years . We have high hope that this public portrayal of the guilt of 718 630 will bring wholesale and permanent revulsion on the part of the masses of our former enemies against war , militarism , aggression 0 and notions of race superiority 0 4 . DEMOBILIZATION OF OUR 250 FORCES The cessation of active campaigning does not mean that we can completely disband 276 fighting 658 . For their sake and for the 326 of their loved ones at home 0 I wish that we could . But we still have the task of clinching the victories we have won - 124 certain that Germany and Japan can never again wage aggressive warfare , that they will not again have the means to bring on another world war . The performance of that task 826 that , together with our allies , we occupy the hostile areas , complete the disarmament of our enemies , and 426 the 874 measures to see to 410 809 they do not rearm . As quickly as possible , we are 328 about the reduction 150 our armed services to the size required for these tasks of occupation and 1051 0 The Army 55 the Navy are following both length - 150 - service and point systems as far as possible in releasing men and women from 413 service . The points 206 based 146 on length and character of service , and on the existence of dependents . 281 0 million from 413 Army have already passed through the separation centers . The Navy , including the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard , has discharged over one and a half million . Of the 12 million men 55 women serving in the Army 55 Navy at the time of the surrender of Germany , one 0 119 have already been released . The greater part of these had to be brought back 470 this country 390 distant parts of the world . Of course there are cases of individual hardship in retention of personnel in the service 0 There will be in the 697 . No system 150 such size can operate to perfection . But the systems are 219 on fairness and justice , 55 they are working at full speed . We shall try to avoid 1076 , injustices , and hardship as far 301 humanly possible 0 We have already reached the point where shipping is no longer the bottleneck in 413 return of troops 390 the European 1019 . The governing factor 920 has become the requirement for troops 60 sufficient strength to carry out their missions . In 1 885 months the same situation 870 exist in 413 Pacific . By the end of June , 9 out of 10 who were serving in the armed forces on V 0 day will have been released . Demobilization will continue 1304 , but at a slower rate , determined by our military responsibilities . 276 national safety and the security 150 the world will require substantial armed forces , particularly in overseas service . At 413 same 455 it is imperative 809 we relieve those who have already done their duty , and that we relieve them as fast as we can . To do that , the Army and the Navy are conducting recruiting drives with considerable success . The Army has 542 nearly 400 , 000 volunteers in the past four months , and the Navy has obtained 80 , 000 . Eighty percent of these volunteers for the regular service have come 390 those already with the colors . 413 Congress has made it possible to offer valuable inducements to those who are eligible for enlistment . 226 effort will be made to enlist the required number of young 95 . The War and Navy Departments now estimate that by a year from now we still will need a strength of about 0 million including officers , for the armed forces - Army , Navy , and Air . I have reviewed their estimates and 63 that the safety 150 the Nation will require 413 maintenance of an 250 strength of this size for the calendar year that is before us . In case the campaign for volunteers does 520 produce that 303 , it will be necessary by additional legislation to extend the Selective Service Act beyond May 16 0 413 date of expiration under existing law . That is the only way we can 408 the men and bring back our 967 . There is no other way . Action along this line should not be postponed beyond March , in order to avoid uncertainty and disruption . DOMESTIC AFFAIRS I . THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK Prophets of doom predicted 809 the United States could not escape a runaway inflation during the war and an economic collapse after the war . These predictions have not been borne 476 . On the contrary , the record of economic stabilization during the war 55 273 the period 150 reconversion has 62 an outstanding accomplishment 0 We know , 1094 , that nothing is as dangerous as overconfidence 0 in 1001 or in peace 0 We have had to fight hard to hold the line . We have made strenuous efforts to speed reconversion . But neither the danger of a postwar inflation nor 150 a subsequent collapse 60 production and employment is yet 399 . We must base our policies not on unreasoning optimism or pessimism but upon a candid recognition of our objectives and upon a careful analysis of foreseeable 959 . Any precise appraisal of the economic outlook at this time is particularly difficult . The period of demobilization and reconversion is fraught with uncertainties . There are also 891 gaps in our 1855 981 . Certain tendencies are , however , fairly clear and recognition of them should serve as background for the consideration of next 216 \\' s Federal Program . In general , the outlook for business is good , and 410 is likely to continue to be good -- provided we control inflation and achieve peace in management - labor relations . Civilian production and employment can be expected to increase throughout the next year . This does not 96 , however , that continuing full employment is assured . It is probable that demobilization of the armed forces will proceed faster than the increase in civilian employment opportunities . Even if substantial further withdrawals from the labor market occur , 786 will 574 temporarily 0 The 920 to which this unemployment will persist depends largely on the speed of industrial expansion and the effectiveness of the policies of the Federal Government 0 Along with extraordinary 104 there are still at this time many critical shortages resulting 390 the war . These extraordinary demands 55 1287 51 lead to a speculative boom 0 especially in the price of securities , real 1111 , and inventories . Therefore , our chief worry 770 is inflation . While 805 control this inflationary pressure 805 must look forward to the time when this extraordinary 104 will subside . It will be years before we catch 86 with the demand for housing 0 The extraordinary 104 350 683 durable goods , for the replenishment of 1106 0 and for exports may 7 satisfied earlier . 120 backlog of demand 54 exist very long in the face of our tremendous productive capacity . We must expect again to face the problem of shrinking demand and consequent slackening in 636 , production , and employment . This possibility of a deflationary spiral in the future will exist unless we now plan and adopt an effective full employment program . 0 . GENERAL POLICIES -- IMMEDIATE AND LONG 0 RANGE During the war , production for civilian use was limited by war needs and available manpower . 251 stabilization required measures to spread 499 supplies equitably by rationing , price controls , increased taxes , savings bond campaigns , and credit controls . Now , with the surrender of our enemies , economic stabilization requires that 508 be directed toward promoting an increase in supplies at low unit prices . We must encourage the development of resources and enterprises in all parts of the country 0 particularly in underdeveloped areas . For 221 , the establishment of new peacetime industries in the Western States and in the South would , in my judgment , add to existing production and markets rather than merely bring about a shifting of production . I am asking the Secretaries of Agriculture , Commerce , and Labor to explore jointly methods for stimulating new industries , 971 in areas with surplus agricultural labor . We must 401 aid small businessmen and particularly veterans who are 1053 to start their own businesses 0 The establishment and development of efficient small business ventures , I believe , will 520 take away from , 408 rather will add to , the total business of all 1555 . Even with maximum encouragement 150 production , we cannot hope to 326 scarcities within a short 455 . The most serious deficiencies will persist in the fields of residential housing 0 building materials , and consumers \\' 248 447 . The critical 1247 makes continued rent control , price control , and priorities , 965 , and inventory controls absolutely essential . Continued control of consumer credit will help to reduce the pressure on prices of durable goods and will also prolong the period during which the backlog demand 870 be effective . While we 206 meeting these immediate needs 805 must look forward to a long - range program of security 55 increased standard of living . The best protection of purchasing power is 1 policy of full production and full employment opportunities . Obviously , an employed worker is a better customer than an unemployed worker . There 1142 will be , 1094 0 some frictional unemployment . In the present period 150 transition we must deal with such temporary unemployment as results 390 the fact 809 demobilization will proceed faster than reconversion or industrial expansion . Such temporary 786 is probably 185 in a period of rapid change . The unemployed worker is a victim of 967 beyond 318 control . He should be enabled to maintain a reasonable standard of living for himself and his family . 413 most serious difficulty in the path of reconversion and expansion is the establishment of a fair wage structure . The ability of labor 55 management to work together , and the wage and price policies which they develop , are social and economic issues of first importance . 480 labor 55 management have a 429 interest . Labor \\' s interest is very direct and personal because working conditions , wages , and prices affect the very 125 and happiness 150 the worker and his family 0 Management has 1 no less direct interest because on management 1205 the responsibility 350 conducting a growing and prosperous business . But 595 and labor have identical 1670 in the long run . Good 1109 mean good markets . 147 business means 315 jobs 55 better wages . In this age of cooperation and in our highly organized economy the problems of one very soon become the problems of all 0 Better human relationships are 51 urgent 64 to which organized labor and management should address themselves . No government policy can make men understand each other , agree , and 408 along unless they conduct themselves in a way to foster mutual respect and good will . 413 Government can , however , 123 470 200 327 which 0 with the backing 150 public opinion , will assist labor and management to resolve their disagreements in a peaceful manner 55 reduce the number 55 duration of strikes . All of 306 realize that productivity -- 578 output 285 man -- is in the long run the basis of our 960 of living 0 Management especially must realize that if labor is to work wholeheartedly for an 574 in production , workers must be given a just share of increased output in higher wages . Most 1285 and most companies have adequate leeway within which to grant substantial wage increases . These increases will have a direct effect 60 increasing 674 demand to the high levels needed . Substantial wage increases are good business for business because they assure a large market for their products ; substantial wage 874 are good business for labor because they increase labor \\' s standard 150 living ; substantial wage increases are good business for the country as a whole because capacity production means an active , healthy 0 friendly citizenry 208 the benefits of democracy under our free enterprise system 0 Labor and management in many industries have been operating 1073 under the Government \\' 300 wage - price policy . 1091 revisions 150 wage scales have been 50 in thousands of establishments throughout the Nation since VJ - day . It is estimated that 479 6 million workers , or more than 20 percent of all employees in nonagricultural and nongovernmental establishments , have received wage increases since August 0 , 1945 0 The amounts of increases given by individual employers concentrate between 10 and 15 percent , but 259 from less than 5 percent to over 30 percent . The United States Conciliation Service since VJ - 15 has settled over 3 , 000 disputes 632 over 1 , 300 , 000 workers without a strike threat and has assisted in settling about 1 , 300 disputes 1018 1235 were threatened which involved about 500 , 000 workers . Only workers directly involved 0 and not those in related industries who might have 62 indirectly affected , are included in these estimates . Many of these adjustments have occurred in key industries and would have seemed to us major 818 if they had 520 been settled peaceably . Within the framework of the wage - price 203 there has been definite success , and it is to be expected that this success will continue in a vast majority of the cases arising in the months ahead . However , everyone who realizes the extreme need for a swift and orderly reconversion must feel a deep concern about the number of major strikes now in progress . If long continued , these strikes could put a heavy brake on 276 594 . I have already made recommendations to the Congress as to the procedure best adapted to meeting the 1014 of work 1239 in Nation - wide industries 1694 sacrificing the fundamental rights of labor to bargain collectively and ultimately to strike in support of 623 position . If we manage our economy properly , the future will see us on a level of production half again as high as anything we have ever accomplished in peacetime . Business can in the future pay higher wages and sell for lower prices than ever before . This is not 611 now for all 559 , nor will it ever be true for all , but for business generally it is 611 . We 206 relying on all concerned to develop 0 through collective bargaining , wage structures that are fair to labor 0 allow 350 874 business incentives , and conform with a policy designed to \" hold the line \" on 598 . Production and more production was 413 byword during the war and still is during the transition from war 470 peace . However , when deferred demand slackens 0 we shall once again face the deflationary dangers which beset this and other countries during the 1930 \\' s . Prosperity can be assured only by a high level of demand supported by 29 current income ; 410 cannot be sustained by deferred needs and use of accumulated savings . If we take the right steps 60 time we can certainly avoid the disastrous excesses of runaway booms and headlong depressions . We must not let a year 270 two of prosperity lull us into a false feeling of security and 1 repetition of the mistakes of the 1920 \\' s that culminated in the crash of 1929 . During the year ahead the Government will be called upon 470 act in many important fields of economic policy from taxation and foreign trade to social security and housing . In every case there 870 be alternatives . We 746 choose the alternatives which will best measure up to our need for 625 production and 730 in the future . We must never lose sight of our long - term objectives : the broadening of markets -- the maintenance of steadily rising demand . This demand 54 come from only three sources : consumers 0 businesses , or government 0 In this country the 82 of production and distribution is in the hands of businessmen , farmers , workers , and professional people -- in the hands of our citizens . We 1251 to keep it that way . However , it is the Government \\' s responsibility to help business , labor 0 and farmers do their jobs . There is no question in my mind that the Government , acting on behalf of all the people , must assume the ultimate responsibility for the economic health of the Nation . There is no other 72 that can . No other organization has 413 scope or 413 authority , nor is any other agency accountable , to all the 270 . This does not mean that 413 Government has the sole responsibility , 320 that it can do the job alone , nor that it can do the 82 directly . All of the policies of the Federal Government must be geared 470 the objective of sustained full production and full 730 -- to raise consumer purchasing power and to encourage business investment 0 The programs we adopt this year and from 920 on will determine our ability to achieve our objectives . We must continue to pay particular attention to our 424 , monetary , and tax policy , programs to aid business -- especially small 973 -- 55 transportation , labor - management relations 55 wage - price policy , social security and health , education , the farm program , public works , housing and resource development 0 and economic foreign policy . For example , the kinds of tax measures we have 401 different times -- whether we raise our revenue in a 811 to encourage consumer spending 55 business investment or to discourage it -- have a vital bearing on this question . It is affected also by regular notions on consumer credit and by the money market , which is strongly influenced by the rate of interest on Government securities . It is affected by almost every step we take . In short , the way we handle the proper functions of government , the 811 we time the exercise of our traditional and legitimate governmental functions , has a vital bearing on the 251 health of the Nation 0 These policies are discussed in greater detail in the accompanying Fifth Quarterly Report of 413 Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion . 0 0 LEGISLATION HERETOFORE RECOMMENDED AND STILL PENDING To attain some of these objectives and to meet the other needs of the United States in the reconversion and postwar period , I have from 455 to time made various recommendations to the Congress 0 In making these recommendations I have indicated the reasons 818 10 deemed them 1101 for progress at 123 and abroad .

So far the fight against inflation has been waged successfully . Since May 1943 , following President 1086 \\' s \" hold the line 0 order and in the face of the greatest pressures which this country has ever seen 0 413 cost of living index 309 risen only three percent . Wholesale prices in this same period have 62 47 470 an increase of two and one - half percent . This record has been made possible by the vigorous efforts of the agencies responsible for this program . But their efforts would have been fruitless if they had not had 413 solid support of the great masses of our people . The Congress is to be 1173 for its role in 433 the legislation under which this work has been carried out . On VJ - day it was clear to all thinking people that the 263 of inflation was by no means over . Many of us 54 remember vividly our disastrous experience following World War I . Then the very restricted wartime 1123 were lifted too quickly , and as a result 598 and rents 125 more rapidly upward . In the year and a half following the armistice , 955 , food , and clothing 778 to higher and still higher levels 0 When the inevitable crash occurred less than two years after the end of the war , business bankruptcies were widespread . Profits were wiped out 0 Inventory losses amounted to billions of dollars . Farm income dropped by one - half . Factory pay rolls dropped 40 percent 0 and nearly one fifth of all our industrial workers were walking the streets 60 search 150 jobs . This was a grim greeting 0 indeed , to offer our 967 who had just returned from overseas . When I addressed the Congress in September , I emphasized that we must continue to hold the price line until the production of goods caught up with the tremendous 404 . 368 then we have seen demonstrated the strength of the inflationary 1396 which we have to face . Retail sales in the closing months of 1945 ran 12 percent 84 413 previous peak for that season , which 49 in 1944 . 598 throughout the entire economy have been pressing hard against the 298 ceilings . The prices of real estate , which cannot now be controlled under the law , are rising rapidly . Commercial rents are 520 included in 413 present price control law and , where they are not controlled by State law , 20 been increasing , causing difficulties to 101 businessmen 0 It will be 847 to maintain a high purchasing power or an expanding production unless we can keep prices at levels which can 7 met by the vast majority of our people . Full production is the greatest weapon against inflation 0 but until we 54 produce enough goods 470 meet the threat of inflation the Government 870 have to 588 its wartime control over prices . I am sure 809 the people of the United States are 931 by 413 demands made 12 several business groups with regard to price and rent control 0 I am particularly disturbed at the effect such thinking may have on 893 and 730 . If manufacturers continue to hold back goods and decline to submit bids 863 invited -- as I am informed some are doing -- 60 anticipation of higher prices which would 1080 the 59 of price controls 0 805 369 inevitably slow down production and create needless unemployment . On the 683 hand , there are the vast majority of 310 businessmen who are not holding back goods , but who need certainty about the Government pricing policy 60 order to fix their own long 0 range 356 policies . Businessmen are entitled therefore to a clear statement of 413 policy of the Government on the subject . Tenants and housewives , farmers 55 workers -- consumers in general -- 20 an equal 621 . We are all anxious to eliminate unnecessary controls 716 as rapidly as we can do so . The steps that we have already taken in many directions toward that end are a clear indication of our policy . 413 present Price Control Act expires on June 30 , 1946 . 90 we expect to maintain a steady 248 we shall have to maintain price and rent control for many months 470 come . 413 inflationary pressures on prices and rents , with relatively few exceptions , are now at an 61 0 455 peak . Unless the Price Control Act is renewed there 870 be no limit to which our price levels would soar . Our country would face a national disaster . We cannot wait to 1060 the act until immediately before it expires . Inflation results from psychological as well as economic conditions . 413 country has a clear right to know where 413 Congress stands on this all - important problem . Any uncertainty now as to 1426 the act will be extended gives rise to price speculation , 470 withholding of goods from the market 60 anticipation of rising prices , and to delays in achieving maximum production . I 74 not 482 that the Congress will be beset by 101 groups who will urge 809 the legislation that I have proposed should either be eliminated or modified to the 610 where it is 296 946 . The Congress has a clear responsibility to meet this challenge with courage and determination . I have every confidence 809 it will do so . I 1063 urge that the Congress now resolve all doubts and as soon as possible adopt legislation continuing rent and price control in effect for a full year from June 30 , 1946 . ( b ) Food subsidies . If the price line is to be held , if 276 people are to 7 protected against 413 inflationary dangers which confront us , we must do more than extend the Price Control 404 . In September we were hopeful that the inflationary pressures 910 by this time have begun to diminish . We were particularly hopeful 120 food . Indeed , it was estimated that food prices at retail would drop 390 3 to 5 per cent 60 the first six months 1143 413 end of the 1001 . In anticipation of this decline in food prices , it was our belief that food subsidies could be removed gradually during the winter and spring months , and eliminated almost completely by 71 0 of this year . It was our feeling that the food 937 could be dropped without an increase to 413 consumer in the present level 150 food prices or in the over - all cost 150 living . As matters stand today , however , food prices are pressing hard against the ceilings . The expected decline 60 224 prices has not occurred , nor is it likely to occur for many months to 118 . This brings me to 413 reluctant conclusion that food subsidies must be continued beyond June 30 , 1946 . 90 we fail to take 718 necessary step , meat prices on July 1 will 7 from 3 to 5 cents higher than their average present levels 0 butter will be 401 least 12 cents 1 pound higher , in 549 to the 5 cents 1 pound increase of last fall ; milk will 574 from 1 to 2 cents a quart ; bread will increase about 1 cent a loaf ; 510 will increase 281 1 cent a 210 ; cheese , in addition to the increase of 4 cents 920 planned for the latter part of this month , 870 go up an additional 8 cents 0 In terms of percentages we may find 413 cost - of - living index for food increased by more than 8 percent , which in 656 would result in more than a 3 - percent increase in the cost of living . If prices of food were allowed 470 increase by these amounts , I must make it clear to the Congress that , in my opinion , it would become extremely difficult for us to control the forces of inflation . None of us likes subsidies 0 276 farmers , in 931 , have always been opposed 470 453 . But I believe our farmers are as deeply conscious as any 359 in 413 land of the havoc which 701 can create . Certainly in the past eighteen 868 there has been no group which has fought any harder in support of 413 Government \\' s price control program . I am confident that , 90 the facts are placed before them and if they see clearly the evils between which we are forced 470 choose , 423 will understand the reasons why subsidies must be continued 0 The legislation continuing the use of food subsidies into the new fiscal year should be tied down specifically to certain standards . 1 very proper requirement , in my opinion , would be 809 subsidies be removed as soon as it is 487 that the cost of living will decline below the present levels . ( c ) Extension of War Powers Act . The Second 1001 Powers Act has 703 been extended by the 931 350 six months instead of for a year . It will now expire , unless further extended , on June 30 , 0 . This act is 413 basis for priority and inventory controls governing the use of 512 materials , as well as for other powers 1101 to orderly reconversion . I think that this Administration has given adequate proof of the fact that it 824 to eliminate 1456 controls 301 quickly and as expeditiously as possible . However , we know that there will continue to be shortages of certain materials caused by the war even after June 30 , 1946 . It is important 809 businessmen 940 now that 987 in short supply are going 470 be controlled and distributed fairly as long as 718 war - born 1287 continue . I , therefore , urge the Congress soon to extend the Second 1001 Powers Act . We cannot afford to wait until just before the act expires next June . To wait would cause the controls to break down in a 978 time , and would hamper our production and employment program . ( d 0 Small business and competition . A rising birth rate for small business , and a favorable environment 350 its growth , are not only economic necessities but also important practical demonstrations of opportunity in a democratic free society 0 A great many veterans and workers with new skills 55 experience will want 470 start in for themselves . The opportunity must be afforded them to 74 so . They are 413 small businessmen of the future . Actually 863 we talk about small business we are 514 about almost all of the Nation \\' 300 individual businesses . Nine out of every ten concerns fall into this category , and 45 743 of 61 workers are employed by them . Between 30 and 40 percent of 413 total value of all business transactions are handled by small business . It is obvious national policy to foster the sound development of small business . It helps 470 maintain high levels of 730 and national income and consumption of the goods and services that the Nation can produce . It encourages the competition that keeps 276 free enterprise economy vigorous and expanding . 401 business , because of its 647 0 assists in the rapid exploitation of scientific and technological discoveries . Investment in small business can 575 a large volume of savings that might otherwise not be tapped 0 The Government should encourage and 310 encouraging small 0 business initiative and originality to stimulate progress through competition . During the war , the Smaller War Plants Corporation assisted small concerns to make a maximum contribution to 699 . 413 work of the Smaller War Plants 1154 310 being carried on in peacetime by the Federal Loan Agency and 413 1185 of Commerce . 413 fundamental 443 to the job of encouraging small concerns must be based on : 1 . Arrangements for making 702 and public financial resources 86 on reasonable terms . 2 . Provision of technical advice and assistance to business 301 a whole on 893 , research , 55 management problems . 718 will help equalize competitive relationships between large and small companies , for many of the small companies 574 435 expensive technical research , accounting , and tax advice . 3 0 Elimination of trade practices and agreements which 223 competition 55 discriminate against 855 or small enterprises . We speak a great deal 479 the free enterprise economy of 276 country . It is competition that keeps it free . It is competition 809 keeps it growing and developing . The truth is that we need 281 more competition in 413 future than we 20 13 in the immediate past . By strangling competition , monopolistic 840 prevents or deters investment in new or expanded production facilities 0 This lessens 413 opportunity 350 employment and chokes off new outlets for 49 savings . Monopoly maintains prices 401 artificially high levels 55 reduces consumption which , with 1105 prices , would rise and support larger production and higher employment . 420 , 520 being subject 470 competitive pressure , is slow to take advantage of technical advances which would lower prices or 411 quality . All three of these monopolistic activities 221 directly lower the standard of 109 -- through higher prices and lower quality 150 product -- which 290 competition would improve . The Federal Government must protect legitimate business and consumers from predatory 55 1133 practices by the vigilant enforcement 150 regulatory legislation . The program will be designed to have a maximum 534 upon monopolistic bottlenecks and unfair competitive practices hindering expansion in employment . During 413 war , enforcement of antimonopoly laws was suspended in 1 number of fields . The Government must now take major steps not only 470 maintain enforcement of antitrust 1131 but to encourage new and competing enterprises in every way . The 503 demand of the war years and the large accumulations 150 liquid assets pro - vide ample incentive for expansion 0 Equalizing of 973 opportunity , under full and free competition , must be a prime responsibility 60 the reconversion period and in the years that follow . Many leading businessmen have recognized the importance of such action both to 1099 and to 413 economy as a whole . But we must do more than break up trusts and monopolies after they have begun to strangle competition . We must take positive action to foster new , expanding enterprises . By 909 and by administration we must take specific steps to 602 the formation 270 the strengthening of competition - restricting business 0 We must 20 an over - all antimonopoly policy which can be applied by all agencies of the Government in exercising the 969 assigned to them -- a policy designed to encourage the formation and growth of new and freely competitive enterprises . Among the many departments and agencies which have parts in the program affecting business and 1138 , the Department of Commerce 309 a particularly important role . That is why 10 have recommended a substantial increase in appropriations 350 the next fiscal year 350 this Department . In its assistance 470 industry , the Department of Commerce will concentrate its efforts on these primary objectives : Promotion 150 a large and well - balanced foreign trade ; provision of improved technical assistance and management aids , 474 for small enterprises ; and strengthening of basic statistics on business operations , both by industries and by regions . To make new inventions and discoveries available more promptly to all businesses 0 small and large , the Department proposes to 200 its own research activities , promote research by universities 0 improve Patent Office procedures , and develop a greatly expanded system of field offices readily accessible to 413 1278 they serve . Many gaps exist in the private financial mechanism , especially in the provision of long - term funds for 401 and medium - sized enterprises . In the peacetime economy the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will take the leadership in assuring adequate financing 350 small enterprises which cannot secure funds 390 other sources 0 Most of the funds should and will be provided by private lenders ; but the Reconstruction 199 Corporation will share any unusual 830 through guarantees of private loans , with direct loans only when 702 capital is unwilling to participate on a reasonable basis . ( e ) Minimum wage . Full employment and full production may be 42 only by maintaining a level of consumer income 281 234 than that of the prewar period . A high level of consumer income will maintain the market for the output of our mills , 621 , 55 factories , which we 20 1479 during the 1001 years that we can produce . One of the basic steps which the Congress can take to establish a high level 150 consumer income is to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to raise substandard wages to a decent minimum and to extend similar 1288 to additional workers who are not 293 by the present act . Substandard wages are bad for business and for 413 farmer . Substandard 1109 375 only a substandard market 350 the 447 and services produced by American industry and agriculture . At the present time the Fair Labor Standards Act prescribes a minimum wage of 40 cents an 284 for those workers who are covered by the 404 . The present minimum wage represents an annual income of about $ 800 470 those continuously employed for 50 1130 -- clearly a wholly inadequate budget for an American family . I 41 in full accord with the proposal now pending in the Congress that 413 1787 minimum be raised immediately to 65 cents an hour , with further increases to 70 cents after 125 year 55 to 75 cents after two years . I also favor the proposal that the industry committee procedure be used to set rates higher than 0 758 per hour during the two - year interval before the 75 - cent basic wage 910 otherwise 125 applicable . The proposed minimum wage of 65 758 an hour would assure the 1295 51 annual income of about $ 1 , 300 a year in steady employment . This amount is clearly a modest goal . After 705 773 - of living increases in recent years , it is 875 more than a 10 0 cent increase over the present legal minimum . In fact , if any large number of workers earn less than this amount , we will find it impossible to maintain the levels 150 purchasing power needed to sustain the stable 1355 which we desire . Raising the minimum to 75 cents an hour will provide the wage earner with an annual income 150 $ 1 0 500 if he is fully employed . The proposed higher minimum wage levels are feasible without involving serious price adjustments or serious geographic dislocations 0 Today about 20 percent 150 our manufacturing wage earners -- or about 2 million -- earn less than 65 cents an hour . Because wages 60 most industries have risen during the war , this is about the same as the proportion -- 17 percent -- 878 1010 319 less than 40 cents an 284 in 1941 . I also recommend that minimum wage protection be extended to several groups of workers 520 now covered . The 64 for a decent standard of living is by 120 means limited to those workers who happen to be covered by the act as it now stands . It is particularly vital at this period of readjustment in 413 national economy and readjustment in employment of 303 to extend minimum wage protection as far 301 possible . Lifting the basic minimum wage is necessary , it is justified as a matter of simple equity to workers 0 and it will prove not only 433 but also directly beneficial to the Nation \\' s employers . ( 80 ) Agricultural programs . The farmers 150 America generally are 723 the crop year 150 1946 in better financial condition than ever before . Farm mortgage debt is the lowest in 30 years 0 Farmers \\' savings are the largest in 998 0 Our agricultural plant 310 in much 1012 condition than after World War I . Farm machinery and supplies are expected to be available in 439 volume , and farm labor problems will be less 415 . The demand for farm products will continue 1023 during the next 216 or two because domestic 903 will be supplemented 12 a high level of exports and foreign relief shipments . It is 904 estimated that from 7 470 10 percent of the total United States food supply may be exported in the calendar 216 1946 . Farm prices are expected to remain at least at their present levels in the immediate future 0 and for at least the next 12 868 they 206 expected to yield 1 net farm income double the 1935 0 39 average and higher than 60 any year prior 470 1943 0 805 can look to 413 future of agriculture with greater confidence 459 in many a year in the past . Agriculture itself is moving 712 ahead , 274 for another year of big production , 484 definite and positive steps to lead the way toward an economy of abundance . Agricultural production goals for 1946 call for somewhat greater acreage than actually was planted 60 1945 . Agriculture is prepared to demonstrate 809 it can make a peacetime contribution as great as its contribution toward 413 winning of the war . In spite 150 supplying 276 armed forces and our allies during the war with a fifth to a fourth 150 276 total food output , farmers 1010 still able to provide our civilians with 8 percent more food per capita than the average for the five years preceding the 1001 . Since the surrender of Japan , civilian food consumption 309 risen still 899 0 By 413 end of 1945 the amount of 413 increase in food consumption was 1165 to be as high as 15 percent over the prewar average . The record shows that the people of this country want and need more food and that 423 will 18 more food if only they have 413 jobs and the 661 power . The first essential therefore in providing fully for the welfare of agriculture 310 to 562 full employment and a high level of purchasing power throughout the Nation 0 For 413 period immediately ahead we 369 still have the 427 of supplying enough food . If we are to do our part in aiding the war - stricken and 970 countries some of the food desires of 276 own people will not be completely satisfied , at least until these nations have had an opportunity to harvest another crop . During 413 515 few months the need for food in the world will 7 more serious than at any 455 273 the war . And 0 despite the large shipments 805 have already made , and despite what we shall send , there remain great needs abroad . Beyond the relief feeding period , there will still be substantial foreign outlets for our farm commodities . The chief 211 of the 526 , however , as always , must be upon the buying power of our own 270 . The first obligation of the 829 to agriculture for the reconversion period is to make 147 on its 298 - 1136 commitments . This we intend to do , with realistic 1173 350 the sound patterns of production that will contribute most to the long - time welfare of agriculture and the whole Nation . The period during which prices are supported will provide an opportunity for farmers individually to strengthen their position in 128 over from a wartime to a peacetime basis of production . It 870 provide an opportunity for the Congress to review the needs of agriculture 55 make changes in national legislation where experience has shown changes to be needed . In this 711 , the Congress will 1118 to consider legislation to 426 the 119 of the 1937 Sugar Act which expires at 413 end of this year . During this period we must do a thorough job of basic 274 470 the end that agriculture shall be able to contribute its full 514 toward a healthy national economy . Our 153 - range agricultural 508 should have two main objectives : First , to assure the people on the farms a fair share of the national income ; and 0 second , to encourage an agricultural production pattern that is best fitted to the 581 \\' s needs . To accomplish this second objective 805 shall have to take into consideration changes that have taken place and will continue to take place in the production of farm commodities -- changes that affect costs and efficiency and 157 . What we 330 932 is a high level 150 food production and consumption that will provide good nutrition for everyone . This cannot be accomplished 12 agriculture alone . We can be certain of our capacity 470 produce food 0 but we 20 often failed to distribute it as well as we should and to see that 276 people 54 afford to buy it 0 The way to get good nutrition for the whole Nation is to provide employment opportunities and purchasing power for 61 groups that will enable 453 to buy full diets at market prices . Wherever purchasing power fails to reach this level we 418 see that they have some means of getting adequate food at 598 in line with their ability to buy . Therefore , we should have available supplementary programs 809 will enable all our 270 to have enough 150 the right kind of 224 . For example , 125 of the best possible contributions toward building a stronger , healthier Nation would be a permanent school - 97 program on a scale adequate to assure every school child a good lunch at noon . The Congress , of course , has recognized this need for a continuing school - lunch program and legislation to 809 effect has been introduced and hearings held . The plan contemplates 413 1357 of this objective 1218 a minimum of Federal 1125 . I hope 809 the legislation will be enacted in time for a permanent program to start 1218 the beginning of the school year next fall . We 20 the technical knowledge 55 413 784 508 to provide 575 of good food for every 91 0 woman , and 55 60 413 United States . It is time we made that possibility a reality . ( g ) Resource development . The strength of 276 Nation and the welfare of the people 905 upon the natural resources 150 the 739 . We have learned that proper conservation of our lands 0 including 276 1355 55 minerals , and wise management of 276 waters will add 490 to 276 612 wealth . The first step in the 829 0 s conservation program must be to find out just what are our 316 resources , and how they 418 be used . We need to take , as soon as possible , an inventory of the lands , the minerals , and the forests of the 581 . During the war it was necessary to curtail some of our long - range plans for development of our natural resources , and to emphasize programs vital to the prosecution of the war . Work was suspended on a number of flood control and reclamation projects and on the 695 of our 612 1355 and parks . This work must now be 560 , and 855 projects must be 741 to provide essential services and to assist in the process 150 economic development . The rivers of America offer a great opportunity to 276 generation in the management of the 612 wealth 0 By a wise use of Federal funds , most of which will be repaid into the Treasury , the scourge 150 554 and drought can be 220 , water can 7 689 to arid lands , navigation 54 be extended , and 97 power can be brought alike 470 the farms and to the 1285 of 276 85 . Through the use of the waters of 413 Columbia River , for example , we 206 672 a 221 agricultural area as large as the State of Delaware . At the same time , we are producing power at Grand Coulee and 401 Bonneville which played a mighty part in 973 the war and which will found 1 609 549 industry in the Northwest . The Tennessee Valley 1105 will resume its peacetime program 150 promoting full use of the resources of 413 82 . We shall continue our plans for the 695 150 413 Missouri Valley , the Arkansas Valley 0 55 413 Central 82 of California . The Congress has shown itself alive to the practical requirements for a beneficial use of our water resources by providing that preference in the sale of power be given to farmers \\' cooperatives and public agencies . The public power program thus authorized 746 continue to be made effective by building the 874 generating and transmission facilities to furnish the maximum of firm power needed at 413 wholesale markets , which are often distant from the dam sites . 718 great developmental projects will open the frontiers of agriculture , industry 0 and commerce . The employment opportunities thus offered will also go far to ease the 1491 from war to peace 0 ( h ) Public works . During the 1001 even urgently needed Federal , State , and local construction projects were deferred in order to release resources for war production . In resuming public works construction , 410 is desirable to proceed only at a 725 rate , since demand for private construction will be abnormally high for some time . Our public 1390 program 418 be timed to reach its peak after demand 350 private construction has begun to taper off 0 Meanwhile , however , plans should 7 prepared if we are to act promptly when the present extraordinary private demand begins to run out 0 The Congress made money available to Federal agencies for their public works planning in the fiscal year 1946 . I strongly recommend that this policy be continued and extended 60 the fiscal year 1947 . State and local governments 20 an essential role to play in a national public works program . In my message 150 September 6 , 1945 , I recommended that the Congress 481 such grants to 1106 and local governments as will insure that 17 level of government makes its proper contribution to a balanced public construction 594 . Specifically , the Federal Government 418 15 State and local governments 60 planning their own public works programs , in undertaking projects related to Federal programs of regional development , and in constructing such public works as are necessary 470 carry 476 413 various policies of the Federal Government . Early in 1945 the Congress made available advances to State and local 1129 for planning public works projects , and 703 made additional provision to continue these 370 through the fiscal year 1946 . I believe that further appropriations will be needed for the same purpose for the fiscal year 1947 . The Congress has already made provision for 840 programs . It is now considering legislation which would expand Federal grants and loans in several other fields , including construction of airports , hospital and health centers , housing 0 water pollution control facilities , and educational plant facilities . I hope 809 early action will 7 taken to authorize these Federal programs . With respect to public works of strictly local importance , 1106 and local governments should proceed without Federal assistance except in planning . This rule should be subject to review 863 and if the 1138 of highly adverse general economic developments warrants it . All 451 and grants 350 public works should be planned and administered in such 1 way that 423 are 689 into accord 1218 the other elements of the Federal Program . Our 153 0 run objective is to achieve a program of direct Federal and Federally 1320 public works which 310 planned in advance and 717 with business conditions . In this way it can make its 1314 1271 to general economic stability 0 ( i ) National housing program . Last September I stated in my message 470 the 931 that housing 1101 high on the 740 of matters calling for decisive action . Since then the housing shortage in countless communities , affecting millions of families 0 has magnified this 64 to action . Today 805 face both an immediate emergency and a major postwar problem . 368 VJ - 15 the wartime housing shortage has 62 growing steadily worse 55 pressure 120 real estate values has increased . Returning veterans often cannot find a satisfactory place for their families to live , 55 many who buy have 470 pay exorbitant 598 . Rapid demobilization inevitably 396 further overcrowding . A realistic and 728 attack on the emergency will require aggressive action by local governments , with Federal aid , to exploit all opportunities and to give the veterans as far as possible first chance at 379 . It 870 require continuation 150 rent control in 987 areas as well 301 legislation to permit 823 of sales prices 0 It will require maximum conversion of temporary war units 350 veterans 0 housing and their transportation to communities with the 810 pressing needs ; the Congress has already appropriated funds for 718 purpose . 413 inflation in the price of housing is growing daily 0 As a 941 150 the housing shortage , it is inevitable that the 1040 dangers of inflation in home values will continue unless the 931 takes action in 413 immediate future . Legislation is now pending in 413 Congress which would provide 350 ceiling prices for old and new houses . The 1105 to fix such ceilings is essential . With such authority , our veterans and other prospective home owners would be protected against a skyrocketing of home prices . The country would be protected from the extension of the 1040 701 in home values which , if allowed to continue , will threaten not only the 1291 program but our opportunities for 925 a 1076 high level of 123 construction . 317 measures are necessary stopgaps 0 but only 1234 . This emergency action , taken alone , is 147 -- but not enough . 413 447 shortage did not start with the war or with demobilization ; it began years before 809 and has steadily accumulated . The speed with which the Congress establishes the foundation for a permanent , long - 259 housing program will determine how effectively we grasp the immense opportunity to achieve our goal of decent housing and to make 447 a major instrument of continuing prosperity and full employment in the years ahead 0 It 870 719 whether we move forward to 1 stable and healthy housing enterprise and toward 433 a decent 123 350 every American family . Production is the only fully effective answer 0 To get the 1148 turning , I have appointed an emergency housing expediter . I have approved establishment of priorities designed 470 assure an ample share 150 scarce materials to builders of houses for which veterans 870 have preference . Additional price and wage adjustments will be made where necessary , and other steps will be taken to stimulate greater production of bottleneck items . I recommend consideration of every sound method for expansion in facilities for insurance of privately financed housing by the Federal Housing Administration and resumption of previously authorized low - rent public housing projects suspended during the war . In order to meet as many demands 150 413 321 situation as possible , a program of emergency measures is now being formulated for action . 718 will include 1085 in 549 to those already taken . As quickly as this program can be formulated , announcement will be made . Last September I also outlined to the Congress 413 basic 768 for the kind 150 decisive , permanent 909 necessary for a long - range 447 program . These 768 place paramount the fact that housing construction and financing for the overwhelming majority of our citizens should be done by private enterprise . They contemplate 401 809 805 afford governmental encouragement to privately financed house construction 350 families of moderate 178 , through extension of 413 successful system of insurance 150 housing investment ; that research be undertaken to develop better and 302 methods of building homes ; that communities be assisted in appraising their housing needs ; that we commence a program of 325 aid , with 291 local participation , to stimulate and promote the rebuilding and 900 of slums and blighted areas -- with 197 use of private capital . It is equally essential that 805 use public funds to assist families of low income who could not otherwise enjoy adequate housing , and 809 we quicken 276 rate of progress in rural housing . Legislation now under consideration 12 413 Congress provides 350 a comprehensive attack jointly by private enterprise , State and local authorities , and the Federal Government . This legislation would make permanent the National Housing Agency and give it authority and funds for much needed technical 55 economic research . It would provide additional stimulus for privately financed housing construction . This stimulus 1433 of establishing a new system of yield insurance to encourage large - scale investment in rental housing and broadening the insuring powers of the 325 Housing Administration and the lending powers of the Federal savings and loan associations . Where private industry cannot 52 , the Government must 785 in to do 413 job . The bill 910 encourage expansion in housing available for the lowest income groups by continuing to provide 622 subsidies for low - rent housing and rural housing . It would facilitate land assembly for urban redevelopment by loans and contributions to local public agencies where the 859 do their share . 870 enactment of permanent 447 legislation along these 395 will not interfere with the emergency action already under way . On the 934 , it would lift us out of a potentially perpetual state of housing emergency . It would offer the best hope and prospect to millions of veterans and other American families that the American system 54 offer more to 453 than temporary makeshifts . I 20 said before that the people of the United 1406 can be the best housed people in the world . 10 repeat that assertion , 55 I welcome the cooperation of the Congress in achieving that goal . ( j ) Social 934 and health . Our Social Security System has just celebrated its tenth 833 . During the past decade this program has supported the 1121 and morale 150 a large 681 of our 270 by 384 some 150 413 hazards and hardships of the aged , 413 unemployed , and widows and dependent children . But 0 looking back over 10 years \\' experience and ahead to the future , 805 cannot fail to see defects and 891 inadequacies in our 1055 as it now exists . Benefits are in many cases inadequate ; a great many persons are excluded from coverage 0 and provision has not been made for social insurance to cover the cost of medical care and the earnings lost by 413 sick and the disabled . In the field of old - age security 0 there 650 to be no adequate reason for excluding such 659 as the self - employed , agricultural and domestic workers , and 545 of non - profit organizations . Since many of these groups earn wages too 900 to permit significant savings for old age , 423 are in special need of the assured income that can be provided by old 0 age insurance . We 746 take urgent measures for the readjustment period ahead . The Congress for some time has been considering legislation designed to supplement at Federal expense , during the immediate reconversion period , 1079 payments to 413 unemployed . Again I urge the Congress to enact legislation liberalizing unemployment 1079 benefits and extending the 293 . Providing for the 1076 consumption 12 the 300 persons and their families is more than a welfare policy ; it is 430 economic policy . 1 sustained high level of consumer purchases is a basic 737 of a prosperous economy . During the war , nearly 5 million men were rejected for military service because of physical 270 mental defects which in 101 cases might 20 been prevented or corrected . This is shocking evidence that large 1138 of the population are at substandard levels of health 0 The need for a program that will give everyone opportunity for medical care is obvious . Nor can there 7 any serious doubt of the Government \\' s responsibility for helping in this human and 414 problem . The comprehensive health program 829 I recommended on November 19 , 1945 , will require 1500 849 to the Social Security System 55 , in 722 1218 other changes that need to be made , will require further consideration of the financial basis for social security . The system of prepaid medical care which I have recommended is expected eventually to require amounts equivalent 470 4 percent of earnings up to $ 3 , 600 a 216 , 829 is about the average of 1040 expenditures 12 individuals for medical care . The pooling of medical 1073 , under a plan which permits each individual to 66 a free choice of doctor and hospital , 910 assure that individuals receive adequate treatment and hospitalization when they are 93 with emergencies for which they cannot budget individually . In addition 0 I recommended insurance 852 to replace part 150 413 earnings 800 through temporary sickness and permanent disability . Even without these 809 321 additions , it would now 7 time to undertake a thorough reconsideration of our 414 security 1131 0 The structure should be expanded and liberalized . Provision should be made for extending coverage credit to veterans for the period of their service in the armed forces . In the financial provisions we must reconcile the actuarial needs of social security , including health insurance , with the requirements of a revenue system that 310 designed to promote a high 76 of consumption and 146 employment . ( k ) Education . Although the major responsibility for 257 education rests with the States , some assistance has 153 been 74 by the Federal Government . Further assistance is desirable 55 essential . There are many areas and some whole States where good schools cannot be provided without imposing an undue 134 tax burden on the citizens . It is 1101 to provide adequate elementary and secondary schools everywhere , and additional educational 1681 for large numbers of people beyond the secondary level . Accordingly , I repeat the proposal of last year \\' s Budget Message that the Federal Government provide 235 15 to assist the States in assuring 315 nearly equal opportunities for a 147 education . The proposed 325 grants for current 580 expenditures should be made 350 the 741 150 improving the educational systern where improvement is most 73 . They should not be used to replace existing non - 325 expenditures , or even to 1180 merely the situation which existed before 413 war . 60 the future we expect incomes considerably higher than before 413 1001 . Higher incomes should make it possible for State and local governments and for individuals to support higher 55 more nearly adequate expenditures for education . 408 622 among the States will still remain 0 and Federal help will still be needed . As a part of our total public works program , consideration should be given to the need for providing adequate buildings for schools and other educational institutions 0 60 view of current arrears in the construction of educational facilities , I believe that 909 to authorize grants for educational 849 , to be 461 by similar expenditures by State 55 local authorities , should receive the favorable consideration 150 the Congress 0 The Federal Government has not sought , and will not seek , to dominate education in the States . It should continue its 1001 role of leadership and advice and , 350 the 741 of equalizing educational opportunity , it should extend further financial support to the cause of education in 507 where this is desirable . ( l ) Federal Government personnel . 413 rapid 969 of the Federal Government from war to peace is reflected in the demobilization of its civilian personnel . The number of these employees in 1069 United States 309 been reduced by more than 0 , 000 from the 901 of approximately 2 , 900 , 000 employed in 413 final months of the war 0 I expect that by next June we 369 have made a further reduction of 142 magnitude and that there 870 be continuing reductions during the next fiscal year 0 Of the 429 wartime agencies now remaining , only a few are expected to continue 465 530 the next fiscal year . At the same time that we have curtailed the number of employees , we have shortened the workweek by one - sixth 270 more 1171 413 Government and have 1184 holidays . The process of readjustment has been 646 and costs 20 been increased by a 30 turn - over in the remaining personnel - particularly by the loss of some 150 our best administrators . Thousands of war veterans have been reinstated or newly 244 in the civil service 0 Many civilians have been transferred from war 377 to their former peacetime agencies 0 1319 standards 0 which had 470 be relaxed 273 the war , 206 now being tightened . The elimination 731 autumn of overtime 1090 for 296 all 325 employees 496 a sharp cut in 623 incomes . For salaried workers , the blow was softened but by no means offset by the increased 906 of pay which had become 594 July 1 . Further adjustments to compensate 350 increased living costs are required . Moreover , we have long needed 1 general upward revision of Federal Government salary scales at all levels in all 569 - 800 , judicial , and executive . Too many in Government have had to sacrifice too much in economic advantage to serve 413 Nation . Adequate 847 will result 60 economies and improved efficiency in 413 conduct of Government business - gains that will far outweigh the immediate costs . I hope the Congress will expedite action on salary legislation for all Federal employees in all branches of the Government . The only exception I 910 66 is in the case of workers 1183 pay rates are established by wage boards ; 1 blanket adjustment 910 destroy the system by which 623 wages are kept 103 with prevailing rates in particular 859 0 The wage boards should he sensitive now , as they were during the 1001 , 470 changes 60 local prevailing wage rates and should 66 adjustments I hope also that the Congress may see fit to enact 909 for the adequate protection of the health and safety of Federal employees , for their coverage under a 1055 of unemployment compensation , and for their return at Government expense to their homes after separation from wartime 529 . 0 m ) Territories , insular possessions , and the District of Columbia . The major governments of the world face few problems as important and as perplexing as those relating to dependent peoples . This 829 is 972 to the 736 principle that it is for the dependent peoples themselves 470 decide what their 1407 shall 7 . To this end I asked the Congress last October to provide a means by which the 270 of 761 283 might choose 623 form 150 government and ultimate status with respect to the United States . I urge , too , that the Congress promptly 21 to the wishes of the people of Hawaii that the Territory be admitted to statehood in our Union , and that 591 action 7 taken with respect to Alaska as 490 as 410 is certain that this is the desire of the people of that great Territory . The people of the Virgin Islands should be given an increasing measure of self - government . We have already determined that 413 Philippine Islands are to 7 independent on July 4 , 1946 . The ravages of war and enemy occupation , however , have placed a heavy responsibility upon the 475 States . I urge that the Congress complete , 301 promptly and as generously as may be possible 0 legislation which will aid economic rehabilitation for the Philippines . This will 7 not 160 a just acknowledgment of the loyalty of the people of the Philippines , but it will help to avoid the economic chaos which otherwise will he their heritage from our common war . Perhaps no 466 in the 153 centuries of colonialism gives 315 hope for the pattern of the future than the 271 of the Philippines . The District 150 Columbia , because of its special relation to the Federal Government , has been treated since 18oo as a 603 207 0 We should move toward a greater measure 150 local 415 - government consistent with 413 constitutional status of the District . We should take 522 1085 to assure that citizens of the United States are not denied 623 franchise merely because 423 reside at the Nation \\' s Capital . III . THE BUDGET FOR THE FEDERAL PROGRAM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1947 SUMMARY OF THE 420 350 the first time since 413 424 year 1930 the Budget for the 515 fiscal year will require no increase in the national debt . 1125 of all kinds , authorized and 426 , in the 515 year are estimated 401 just above 35 . 8 billion dollars . Net receipts 206 estimated at 0 . 5 202 dollars . The estimated difference of 4 . 3 202 dollars will 7 445 by a reduction in the 221 substantial balance 829 will be 60 the Treasury during the next fiscal year . A large part of the 1145 outside defense and war liquidation , aftermath of war , and international finance , classified as \" other 1145 in a 1143 table , is still due to repercussions of the war . These \" other activities include more than 2 billion dollars for aids to agriculture and net outlays for the Commodity Credit Corporation -- almost double the expenditures for the same purposes in prewar years . This increase is due mainly 470 1125 for purposes of price stabilization and price support resulting from the war food production program . Other increases in this category are due to the fact 809 certain wartime agencies now in the process of liquidation are included 60 this group of 1145 . If all expenditures 350 783 activities which are directly or indirectly related to the war are excluded , the residual expenditures are below those for 1045 1145 60 prewar years . In 124 this comparison account should 7 taken of the fact that , while prewar expenditures were 578 by direct 330 and work relief for the unemployed , the postwar budgets are affected by the considerable increase in pay rates and other increases 60 costs and prices . To elaborate , the Budget , as 10 have remarked above , reflects on both sides of the ledger 413 Government \\' s program 301 recommended 12 413 Executive . It includes estimates not only of 1125 and receipts for which legislative authority already exists , but also of expenditures and receipts for which authorization is recommended . The Budget total for the 515 fiscal year , the year that ends on June 30 , 1947 , is estimated at just above 35 0 8 billion dollars -- about a third of the 720 for 136 war , although nearly four times 413 prewar budgets . This estimate is based on the assumption that a rapid liquidation 150 the war program will be associated with rapid reconversion and expansion of peacetime production . The total includes net outlays of Government corporations . The estimated expenditures in the next and current fiscal year compare as follows with those of a year of global war and a prewar year 0 TOTAL BUDGET EXPENDITURES Fiscal year : 0 in millions ) 1947 $ 35 , 860 1946 67 , 229 1945 100 , 031 1940 9 0 252 Although 1290 350 occupation , demobilization , and defense are drastically reduced in the fiscal year 1947 , they 870 still amount to 42 percent of 413 total Budget . The so - 73 \" aftermath of war \" expenditures account for a further 30 743 of the total . 413 total of 61 other programs , which was drastically cut during the war , is increasing again as liquidation of the war program proceeds and 1069 emphasis is placed on the peacetime objectives of the 829 . On the 683 side of the ledger , net receipts are estimated at 31 . 5 billion 635 . This estimate assumes that 61 existing taxes will continue all through the fiscal year 1947 . Included are the extraordinary 1003 from the disposal of surplus property . As a result 0 estimated expenditures will exceed estimated receipts by 4 . 3 billion 635 . This amount can be provided by a reduction in the cash balance in the Treasury . Thus , after a 153 period of increasing public debt resulting 390 depression budgets 55 war budgets , it is anticipated that no increase in the Federal debt will he required next year . The current fiscal 216 , 1946 , is a 216 of transition 0 863 the year opened , in July 1945 , 805 were still fighting a major war , and Federal expenditures were running 401 an annual rate of about 0 billion dollars . By June 1946 that rate will be more than cut in half . The Budget total for 413 current fiscal year is now estimated at 67 . 2 billion dollars , of which more than 1270 - thirds 675 for war and war liquidation . Since net receipts are estimated at 38 0 6 billion dollars , there will be an excess of expenditures 150 28 . 6 billion 635 for the current fiscal year . For all 894 discussed in this Message 10 estimate the total of 420 appropriations and authorizations ( including reappropriations and permanent appropriations ) at 30 , 982 million dollars for 413 fiscal year 1947 0 Of this amount , present permanent appropriations are expected to 375 5 , 755 million dollars 0 principally for interest . This leaves 24 , 224 million 635 to be made available through new appropriations , exclusive of appropriations to liquidate contract authorizations 0 900 million dollars in new contract 1533 ; and 103 million dollars through the reappropriation of 626 balances of previous appropriations . The appropriations needed 470 liquidate 1127 authorizations are estimated at 1 , 113 million dollars . In the Budget for the year ahead only over - all estimates are included at this time for the major war agencies and for net outlays of Government corporations . 459 recommendations will be transmitted in the 643 for the war agencies 0 and the business 0 type budgets of Government corporations will likewise be transmitted in accordance with the recently adopted Government Corporation Control Act 0 Similarly , only overall 1461 are provided for new programs recommended in this Message ; detailed recommendations will be transmitted 686 authorizing legislation has been enacted . It should be 357 that many of the estimates for new programs recommended in this Message are initial year figures . These figures will be 578 by the date the legislation is enacted and by the time 73 for getting a program under way . New programs , such as that for a national research 72 , will require larger amounts in later years . The estimates 113 major elements of the proposed national health 594 368 the greater part of these will be covered by expenditures from trust funds . 413 Budget total includes expenditures for capital outlay as well as for current operations . An estimated 0 , 740 million dollars will be expended in the fiscal year 1947 for direct Federal 131 works and for loans and grants for 131 1390 . THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE LIQUIDATION OF THE WAR PROGRAM Government programs are of such importance in 413 development of production and employment opportunities - domestic and international -- that it has become essential to formulate and consider the Federal Budget in the light of the Nation \\' s budget as a whole . 413 relationship between 413 receipts , expenditures , and savings of consumers 0 business , and government is shown in the accompanying table 0 Considering the whole Nation , total expenditures must equal the 901 receipts , because what any individual or group spends becomes receipts of other individuals 270 groups . Such 562 can he achieved on either a high level of incomes or on a low or depression level of incomes . Tremendous orders for munitions during the war shifted production and employment into high gear . Total goods produced and services rendered for private as well as for 829 purposes -- the 581 0 s 420 -- reached about 200 billion dollars in the calendar year 0 . Federal , State , and local 829 expenditures represented half of this total . Corresponding estimates for the 781 3 months depict the national economy in the 958 of 709 and reconversion . The wartime annual rate 150 Federal expenditures has been reduced by 32 billion 635 , while the Nation \\' s budget total 309 dropped only half as much . The 354 in total value 150 production and services 309 been less 918 because increasing private activities 20 absorbed in large measure the manpower and materials released from war production and war services . The largest increase in private activities has occurred in business investments , which include residential and other construction , producers \\' durable equipment , accumulation of inventories , and 455 exports . Under conditions of 136 1001 , expenditures for private construction and equipment were held to a minimum and inventories were 533 . With the beginning 150 reconversion these developments have been 725 . Residential construction and outlays for plant and equipment are on the increase ; inventories , too 0 are 70 replenished . International transactions ( excluding landless and international relief which are included 265 war expenditures ) showed an import surplus under conditions of global war . In the past 3 months private 1115 have been slightly in excess of imports , for the 990 time since 1941 . Consumers \\' budgets show a significant change . On the income side , 623 total has 111 but little because the reduction in \" take - home \" pay of war 1595 is , to a large extent 0 offset for the time 70 by the 1014 - out payments 238 by war veterans and by unemployment compensation received by the unemployed . On the expenditure side , however , consumers budgets , restricted during the war , 20 increased substantially as 1 result of the fact that scarce goods are beginning to appear on the 666 and wartime restraints are disappearing . Thus , consumers \\' current savings are declining substantially from 413 extraordinarily high wartime rate and some wartime savings are beginning to be used for long - delayed purchases 0 Unemployment has increased less than was expected during 718 990 period of demobilization and reconversion . It is true that 6 million men and women have been discharged from the armed forces since May 1945 and more than 5 million have 62 laid off from war work 0 On the other hand , 315 than a million civilians have been enlisted in the armed forces , a considerable 303 of war 967 have not immediately 787 jobs , and many war workers , especially women , have withdrawn from 413 labor 358 . In addition , many industries , and especially service trades which were undermanned during the war , are beginning now , for the first 455 in years , 470 recruit an adequate labor force 0 The reduced workweek has also contributed to 413 absorption of those released from war 529 and war work . In general , 413 drastic cut in war programs has thrown the economy into 1105 gear ; 410 has not thrown it out of gear . Our economic machine demonstrates remarkable 623 , although there are many difficulties 809 746 still be overcome . The 295 termination of war contracts 0 prompt clearance of unneeded Government - owned equipment from private plants , and other reconversion 508 have greatly speeded up the beginning of peacetime work in reconverted plants . Although the first great shock of demobilization and war - work termination has thus been met 1012 than many observers expected , specific industries and specific regions show much unevenness in the 1158 of reconversion . The Quarterly 955 of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion analyzes the difficulties in recruiting personnel and obtaining materials that hamper 969 in certain industries and proposes policies to 40 with these situations . The lack of adequate housing 310 one of the main factors checking the flow of workers into areas where job opportunities exist . FEDERAL REVENUE 0 BORROWING , AND THE PUBLIC DEBT I . FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS AND TAX 203 Recommendations for tax legislation should be considered not only in the light of the financial requirements of the ensuing year , but also in the 451 of future years financial requirements and a full consideration of economic conditions . Expenditures are 1165 at nearly 36 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1947 ; 423 can hardly he expected to be reduced to less than 25 billion dollars in subsequent years . Net receipts in 413 fiscal year 1947 are estimated at 0 . 0 202 dollars . Included in this estimate are 2 billion dollars of receipts from 795 and rental of surplus 1045 and 190 million dollars of receipts from renegotiation of wartime contracts . These sources of receipts will disappear in future years . Tax collections 350 the fiscal year 1947 also will not yet fully reflect the reduction in 1029 tax liabilities provided 60 the Revenue 404 of 1945 . If the extraordinary receipts from the disposal of surplus property and renegotiation of contracts 7 disregarded , and if the tax reductions adopted in the Revenue Act of 1945 were fully effective , present tax rates would yield about 27 billion dollars . 718 estimates for the fiscal year 1947 are based on the assumption of generally favorable 973 conditions but not 120 an income reflecting full employment and the high productivity that we 163 to achieve . In future years the present 461 system , in conjunction with a full employment level 150 national income , could be expected 470 yield more than 30 billion dollars , which is substantially above the anticipated peacetime level of expenditures . In view of the still extraordinarily large expenditures in the coming year and continuing inflationary pressures 0 I am making no recommendation for tax 748 at this time . We have already had a substantial reduction in taxes from wartime peaks . The Revenue Act of 1945 was a major tax - reduction measure . It decreased the total 461 load by more than one - sixth , an amount substantially in excess of 413 reductions proposed by the Secretary of the 1122 to congressional tax committees in October 1945 . These proposed reductions were designed to 343 reconversion and peacetime business expansion . The possibility of further tax reductions must depend on the budgetary situation and the economic situation . The level of 964 expenditures for the fiscal 216 1947 and the volume of 1294 public debt require the maintenance of large revenues . 596 , 912 pressures still appear dangerously powerful , and ill - advised tax reduction would operate to strengthen them still further . 50 decision not to recommend additional tax reductions at this time is made in the 451 of existing economic conditions and prospects . BORROWING AND THE PUBLIC DEBT The successful conclusion of the Victory loan marked the end of war borrowing and the beginning of the transition to postwar debt management . Because of the success of the Victory loan , I am happy to report that the Treasury 870 not need to borrow any new money from the 131 during the remainder of the present fiscal year except through regular sales of savings bonds and savings notes . Furthermore , a part of the large 312 balance now in the Treasury will be used for debt redemption so that the public debt which now amounts to 479 278 billion dollars will 523 by several billion dollars during the next 18 months . The present statutory debt limit 150 300 billion dollars will provide an ample margin for all of the public - debt transactions through 413 fiscal year 1947 . The net effect of the excess of expenditures and debt redemption on the Treasury cash balance , as compared with selected previous years , is shown in the following table : Although the public debt is expected to decline , 1 substantial volume of refinancing will be required , because of the large volume of maturing obligations . Redemptions of savings bonds also have been running high in recent months and are expected to remain large for some time . The issuance of Savings bonds will be continued . 718 bonds represent a convenient method of 1266 for small savers , and also 51 anti - inflationary method of refinancing . Government agencies and trust funds are expected to 18 about 2 0 5 billion 635 of Government securities during the 515 6 months , and 0 . 8 billion dollars 315 during the fiscal year 1947 . 695 these and other debt operations , the distribution of the Federal debt among the various types of public and private owners will 70 , even 495 the total is expected 470 decline . 413 interest policies followed in the refinancing 1186 will have a major impact not only on the provision 350 interest payments 60 future budgets , but also on the level of interest rates prevailing in private financing . The average rate of interest on the debt is now a little under 2 percent . Low interest rates will be an important 358 in promoting the full production and full 730 in the postwar period for which we 206 all striving . Close wartime cooperation between the Treasury Department and the 325 Reserve System has made it possible to finance the most expensive war in history at low and stable rates of interest . This cooperation will continue . No 635 important than the level of interest rates paid on the debt is the distribution of its ownership . Of the total debt , more than half represents direct savings of individuals or investments of funds received from individual Savings 12 life insurance 559 , 483 Savings banks , Savings and loan associations , private or Government trust funds , and other agencies 0 Most of the remaining debt - more than 100 billion dollars -- is held by the commercial banks 55 413 Federal Reserve 373 . Heavy purchases 12 the banks were necessary to provide adequate funds to 199 war 1125 . A considerable portion of these obligations are short - term in character and hence will require refinancing 60 the coming 868 and years . Since they have been purchased out of newly created bank funds , continuance 150 413 present 900 rates of interest 310 entirely appropriate . To do otherwise would merely increase bank profits at 413 expense of the taxpayer . The 275 - 202 - 335 debt poses 1 problem 809 826 careful consideration in the determination of 235 and economic 508 . We have learned that the problem , serious as it is , can 7 managed . Its management will require determined action 470 keep our 325 Budget in order and to relate our fiscal policies to the requirements of an expanding 248 . The more successful we are in achieving 146 production and full employment the easier it will he to manage the debt and pay for the debt service 0 239 though the debt is , it is within our economic capacity . The interest charges on it amount to but a 401 proportion of 276 national income . The Government is determined , by a resolute policy of economic stabilization 0 to protect the interests of the millions of American citizens who have invested in its securities . During the past 6 months the net revenue receipts of the Federal Government 20 62 about 20 billion dollars , almost 301 57 as during the closing 6 months 150 1944 when the country was still 71 in all 0 out warfare . The high 76 of these receipts reflects the smoothness of the reconversion and particularly the strength of consumer demand 0 But 413 receipts so far collected 0 it 746 be remembered , do not reflect any of the tax reductions made by the Revenue Act of 1945 . These 1048 will not have their full effect on 413 revenue collected until the fiscal year 1948 . It is good to move toward a 96 budget and a start on the retirement of the debt at a time when demand for goods is strong and the business outlook is good . These conditions prevail today . Business 310 good 55 there are still powerful forces working in the direction of inflation . This is not the time for tax reduction . RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC FEDERAL ACIVITIES I . WAR 691 AND NATIONAL DEFENSE ( a 0 War expenditures . The fiscal year 1947 will see a continuance of war liquidation and occupation . During this period 805 shall also lay the foundation for our peacetime system of national defense . In the 424 year 809 ended 120 June 30 , 0 , almost wholly a period of global war - fare , war 1125 amounted 470 90 . 5 billion dollars . For the fiscal year 1946 . war expenditures were originally estimated at 70 billion dollars . That estimate was 50 a year ago while we were still engaged in global warfare . After 699 over Japan this estimate was revised to 50 . 5 billion dollars . Further cut - backs and accelerated demobilization have made possible an additional reduction in the rate 150 1001 spending . During the first 6 months 32 . 9 billion dollars were spent . It is now estimated that 16 0 1 billion dollars will be spent during the second 6 months , or a total of 0 billion 635 during the whole fiscal year . For the fiscal year 1947 it 310 estimated , tentatively , that expenditures 350 war liquidation 0 for occupation , and for national defense will 7 reduced to 0 billion dollars . The War and Navy Departments are expected to 439 13 billion dollars ; expenditures 150 other agencies 0 such as the United States Maritime Commission , the War Shipping Administration 0 and the Office 150 Price Administration , and payments to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are estimated at 3 billion dollars . Allowing for estimated net receipts of 1 billion dollars arising from war activities 150 the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , the estimated total of war expenditures is 15 billion dollars . At this time Only a tentative break - down of the total estimate for 1001 and defense activities can be indicated . An expenditure of 15 billion dollars for 1001 liquidation , occupation , and national 449 is a large sum for a year which begins 10 months after fighting has ended . It is 10 times our expenditures for defense before the war ; it amounts to about 10 percent of our expected national income . This estimate reflects the immense job that is involved in winding up a global 1001 effort and stresses the great responsibility that victory has placed upon 718 country . The large expenditures needed for our national 449 emphasize the great scope for effective organization in furthering economy and efficiency . To this end I have recently recommended 470 the Congress adoption of legislation combining the War and Navy Departments into a single Department 150 National Defense . A large part of these expenditures is 770 to be attributed 470 the costs of the . war . Assuming , somewhat arbitrarily , that 479 one - half of the 0 - billion - dollar outlay for the fiscal 216 1947 is for war liquidation , aggregate expenditures 12 718 Government for the second World War are now estimated at 347 billion dollars through June 30 , 1947 . Of this , about 9 202 dollars will have been recovered through renegotiation and sale of surplus property 12 June 30 , 1947 ; this has been reflected in the estimates 150 receipts . Demobilization and 1366 of armed forces 0 Demobilization of our armed 658 is proceeding rapidly . At the time of 699 in Europe , about 12 . 3 million men and women were in the 250 forces ; 7 . 6 million were overseas . By the end of December 1945 our armed 658 had been reduced to below 7 million . By June 30 , 1946 , they 870 number about 2 . 9 million , of whom 1 . 8 million will be individuals enlisted and inducted after VE - day . 1014 - out pay is a large item of our war liquidation expense ; it will total 2 . 5 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1946 0 and about 500 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947 . In 413 fiscal year 1947 the strength of our armed forces 870 still be above the ultimate peacetime level . As I have said , War and Navy Department requirements indicate a 1366 150 about 2 million in the armed forces a year 390 now . This is necessary 470 enable us to do our share 60 the occupation 150 enemy territories 55 in the preservation of 94 in a troubled world . 1125 for pay , subsistence , travel , and miscellaneous expenses of the armed forces , excluding mustering - out pay 0 are estimated at 5 billion dollars . Contract settlement and 922 property disposal .-- The winding up of war procurement is the second 810 important liquidation job . By the end of November a total of 0 , 000 prime contracts involving commitments 150 0 billion dollars had been terminated . Of this total , 67 , 000 contracts 1218 commitments of 35 202 dollars remained to be settled . Termination payments on these contracts are estimated 401 about 3 . 5 billion dollars . It is expected that more than half of these terminated contracts will be settled 273 the current fiscal 216 , leaving payments of 479 1 . 5 billion dollars for the fiscal year 1947 0 Another important 789 of war 506 liquidation is the disposal 150 surplus property . Munitions , ships , plants , installations , and supplies , originally costing 50 202 dollars or more , will ultimately be declared surplus . The sale value of this property will 7 far less than original cost 55 disposal expenses are estimated at 0 to 15 cents on each dollar realized . Disposal units within existing agencies have been organized to liquidate surplus property under the 752 of the Surplus Property Administration . Overseas disposal activities have 62 centralized in the State Department to permit this program to he carried on in line with over - all 418 policy . Thus far only about 13 billion dollars of the ultimate surplus 0 166 5 billion dollars of unsalable aircraft 0 309 been 252 0 Of this amount , 2 . 3 billion dollars have been disposed 150 0 60 sales yielding 600 240 dollars . The tremendous job of handling surplus stocks will continue to affect Federal expenditures and receipts for several years . The speed 55 effectiveness of surplus disposal operations will be 150 great importance for the domestic economy as well as 350 418 economic policies . War 811 , maintenance , and relief .-- Adequate provision for the 612 defense requires that we keep abreast of scientific and technical advances 0 The tentative estimates for the fiscal year 1947 make allowance for military research , limited procurement of weapons in the developmental state , and some regular procurement of munitions which were developed 408 520 mass - produced when the war ended . Expenditures for procurement 55 construction will constitute one - third or less of total defense outlays , compared to a ratio 150 two - thirds during the war years 0 The estimates also provide for the maintenance of our war 0 expanded naval and merchant 820 , military installations , and stocks of military equipment and supplies . Our naval combatant fleet is three times its pre - Pearl 481 tonnage . Our Merchant Marine is five times its prewar size . The War Department has 502 of dollars worth of equipment 55 supplies . Considerable 615 and repair expense 310 necessary for the equipment which we desire to retain in active status or in war 721 . Expenses will be incurred for winnowing the stocks of surpluses , for preparing lay - up facilities for the reserve fleets , and 350 storage 150 721 equipment 55 supplies . Military expenditures in the current fiscal year 108 0 million dollars for civilian supplies for the prevention of starvation and disease in occupied areas . Expenditures on this account will continue in the fiscal year 0 0 The war expenditures also cover the expenses of civilian administration in occupied 507 . During the war 0 0 cents of each dollar 150 our war expenditures was for lend - lease aid . With lend - lease terminated , I 553 the direct operations under 718 program to be 1540 completed in the current fiscal year . The expenditures estimated for the fiscal year 1947 265 this program 206 mainly inter - agency reimbursements for past transactions . 330 and rehabilitation expenditures 206 increasing . It is imperative that we give 61 necessary aid within our means 470 the people who have borne the ravages of war . I estimate 809 in the fiscal year 1946 1125 for 413 United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will total 1 . 3 billion dollars 55 in the following year 1 0 2 billion dollars . Insofar as possible , procurement for this purpose will be from war surpluses . ( b ) Authorizations for war 55 612 defense . During the war 0 authorizations and appropriations had to be enacted well in advance 150 646 and spending to afford ample time for 274 of 893 by the procurement 829 and by industry 0 Thus our cumulative war program authorized in the period between July 1 , 0 , 55 July I , 1945 , was 0 billion dollars , including net war commitments of Government corporations . Expenditures 765 those authorizations totaled 290 billion dollars . This left 141 202 dollars in unobligated authorizations 55 unliquidated 946 . With the end of fighting , it became necessary to adjust war authorizations to the requirements of war liquidation 55 continuing national defense 0 Intensive review of the war authorizations by 480 the executive and the legislative 569 has been continued since VJ - 15 . As a result , the 711 war program is being brought more nearly 530 line with expenditures . 1548 and authorizations through the fiscal year 1946 .-- Readjusting the war program , as the Congress 865 knows , 310 not an 316 task . Authorizations must not be too 821 , lest we 334 necessary operations 0 they 746 not be too 156 , lest we lose control of spending . Last September , 10 transmitted to the Congress recommendations on the basis of which 413 Congress voted H 0 200 . 4407 to repeal 50 . 3 billion dollars of appropriations and authorizations . I found it necessary 470 veto 718 bill because it was used as a vehicle for legislation that would 341 the reemployment program . However , in order to preserve the fine work of the Congress on the rescissions , I asked the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to place the exact 867 indicated for repeal in a nonexpendable 721 , 55 to advise the departments and 377 accordingly 0 This has been done . In accord with Public Law 132 150 413 Seventy - ninth Congress , I have transmitted 1248 for additional rescissions 350 the current fiscal year of appropriations amounting to 5 . 8 202 dollars and of contract authorizations 964 420 million 635 . The net 748 60 authority to 521 will be 5 . 0 billion 635 , because , of the appropriations , 1 . 0 billion dollars will 20 to be 1184 in subsequent years to liquidate contract authorizations still on the books . The appropriations recommended for 321 include 2 , 827 million dollars for the Navy Department , 1 , 421 million dollars for 413 1001 Department , 850 million dollars for lend - lease , 384 million dollars for the War Shipping Administration , 55 260 million dollars 350 413 United States Maritime Commission 0 The contract authorizations 809 for repeal are for the Maritime Commission . In addition , there are unused tonnage authorizations for construction 150 naval vessels 920 valued at 5 . 4 billion dollars . In September 1945 , I suggested that this authority be reviewed by the appropriate committees of the Congress , and the Congress has moved to bar construction under these authorizations during the remainder of the fiscal year 1946 . I propose to continue this prohibition in the Navy budget 1461 for the fiscal year 1947 and now renew 50 recommendation that legislation be enacted at the earliest time to clear the statute books of these authorizations . The amounts indicated for repeal in H . R 0 0 55 the further rescissions which 10 20 recommended , 171 duplications and deferred cash payments on existing authorizations , represent a cut in the authorized war program 150 0 0 8 billion 635 . The war authorizations will also 7 227 3 0 7 billion dollars by carrying receipts of revolving accounts to surplus 0 by lapses , and by cancellation and 791 of commitments of the 829 war corporations . On the other hand 0 supplemental appropriations of 600 million dollars will be required for the United Nations Relief and 1197 1546 . In the net , it is estimated that the cumulative 711 war and national defense program will amount to 368 billion dollars on June 30 , 1946 0 Expenditures of 0 billion 635 during the fiscal year 1946 870 have pushed cumulative 1125 to 339 billion dollars . The unexpended balances will be down to 0 billion dollars on 71 30 , 0 . New authorizations 350 national defense and 1001 liquidation in the fiscal year 1947 0 -- The expenditures of 15 202 dollars for national 449 55 war liquidation in the fiscal year 1947 will be partly for payment of 1164 obligations incurred in the past , and 721 for the 586 of new obligations . 413 unexpended balances on June 30 , 1946 , will be scattered among hundreds of separate 1552 . Thus , while some appropriation accounts will have 371 balances , others will require additional appropriations . It is estimated that authorizations 470 incur new obligations of 11 , 772 240 635 will be needed during the fiscal year \\' 947 , mainly for the War and Navy Departments . Of the required authorizations , 11 , 365 million dollars will be in new appropriations , 400 million dollars in new contract authority , and 7 million dollars 60 reappropriations of 581 balances 0 In addition , appropriations of 0 million dollars will be needed 470 liquidate obligations under existing contract authorizations . Taking 530 account the tentative authorizations 55 1125 estimated for the fiscal year 1947 , and offsets of 3 billion dollars in war commitments of Government corporations , the 507 authorized war and national defense program on June 30 , 1947 , will be 376 billion dollars ; total expenditures , 354 billion dollars ; and unexpended balances , 22 billion dollars . The 0 202 dollars 150 unexpended balances tentatively indicated as of June 30 , 0 , comprise both unobligated authorizations and 626 obligations 0 Most of 413 unliquidated obligations 941 from transactions booked during the war years . A 239 part of the 22 billion dollars would never be spent even if not repealed , for the appropriations will lapse 60 due 584 . For example , several billion dollars of 718 unliquidated obligations represent unsettled inter 0 and intra - departmental agency accounts for war procurement . Legislation is being requested to facilitate the adjustment of some of these inter - agency accounts . Another 6 billion dollars is set aside 350 contract termination payments . If contract settlement costs continue in line with recent experience , it is likely that part of the 6 billion dollars will remain unspent . On the other hand 0 some of the 22 billion dollars would be available for obligation 55 expenditure unless impounded . In certain appropriations , such as those for longcycle procurement , considerable carryover of unliquidated obligations into future years is 470 be expected and is necessary . However , substantial further rescissions can and should he made when the 1001 liquidation program tapers off 55 budgetary requirements for national defense 206 clarified . As I have said , I shall continue to review the war authorizations and from time to time recommend excess balances for repeal . As in recent 516 0 detailed recommendations concerning most 1552 for 413 national defense program are postponed until the spring . In connection with 413 war activities of the United States Maritime Commission and certain 683 agencies , however 0 I now make specific recommendations for the fiscal 216 1947 . No 580 authorizations 270 appropriations 870 be necessary for the Maritime Commission since sufficient balances will he left after the above mentioned rescissions to carry out the program now contemplated for the fiscal year 1947 0 2 . AFTERMATH OF WAR Nearly one - third -- 0 billion dollars -- of 1165 Federal expenditures in the 424 year 1947 will 7 350 purposes that are largely inherited 390 the war - payments to veterans , interest on the Federal debt , and refunds of taxes . ( a ) For veterans . \" Veterans \\' pensions and 852 \" has become one of the largest single categories in the Federal 420 . I am recommending for this purpose total appropriations of 4 0 787 million dollars 350 the fiscal year 1947 . Expenditures in the fiscal year are estimated , 265 present legislation , at 4 , 208 million dollars . These expenditures will help our veterans through their readjustment 369 and provide lasting 209 for those who were disabled . The Congress has provided unemployment allowances for 967 during their readjustment period 0 Expenditure of 850 million dollars for this purpose is anticipated for the 424 year 1947 . 60 addition , readjustment allowances for self - employed veterans are expected to cost 340 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947 . On May 28 0 1945 , 60 asking the Congress to raise the ceiling on benefits for 120 unemployed to not less than 25 dollars a week during the immediate reconversion period , I suggested that 413 Congress also consider liberalizing veterans \\' allowances . Elsewhere in this Message I reiterate my recommendation with respect to emergency unemployment compensation . I also recommend increasing veterans \\' unemployment allowances from 0 dollars to 25 dollars a week . This would involve additional expenditures estimated at 987 220 million dollars for the fiscal year . Included in the 1947 Budget is an 825 of 535 240 dollars for veterans \\' education under provisions of the Servicemen \\' s Readjustment Act . This amount 408 both tuition expenses and maintenance allowances . It is expected that half a million veterans will be enrolled in our schools and colleges during the 216 . The ultimate benefit 829 967 receive from the loan guarantee provisions 150 the Servicemen \\' s Readjustment Act depends largely on the success of our stabilization 594 in restraining building costs and real estate 348 . Under 413 revised procedure contained in recent amendments , the 1437 workload will be minimized by the almost 633 transfer of authority for 500 the 971 to private lending 377 and private appraisers designated by the Veterans Administration . This 1105 carries with it the responsibility for restricting the guarantees to loans on reasonably valued properties . Costs of 413 program 0 other than for administration , 206 estimated 401 21 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947 . 865 for veterans will require expenditures estimated 401 0 0 748 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947 . 1270 - thirds of this amount will be received by veterans of the war which we have just 920 . This figure includes 55 240 635 150 increased pensions for student - veterans in our vocational rehabilitation program . In addition , 170 million dollars will 13 expended in transfers to 413 National Service Life Insurance Fund from 294 and special accounts . Expenditures under the appropriation for salaries and expenses of the Veterans Administration are estimated at 528 million dollars in 413 fiscal year 1947 . This includes 260 million dollars for medical care and the operation of 415 103 0 000 hospital and domiciliary 311 . A separate appropriation 350 hospital and domiciliary facilities , additional to the total for veterans \\' pensions and benefits , covers construction that will provide 415 0 , 000 hospital 311 as 681 of the 500 0 million dollar hospital construction program already authorized by the 931 . The estimated expenditures of 130 million 635 for 718 purpose are classified 60 the Budget as part 150 the general public works program for the next fiscal year . ( b ) For interest . Interest payments on the public debt are estimated at 5 billion dollars in the fiscal year 0 , an increase of 250 million dollars from the revised 1161 for the current fiscal year . This increase reflects chiefly payment of interest on 849 to the debt this year . Assuming continuance of present interest rates , the Government \\' s interest bill is now reaching the 390 postwar level . ( c ) For refunds . An estimated total 150 1 , 585 million dollars of refunds will he paid to individuals and 1454 during the fiscal year 1947 . Slightly over half of this amount , or 80 million dollars , will 7 accessory to the simplified pay - as - you - go method of 461 collection , 55 will be the result of overwithholding and overdeclaration of expected income . Most of the remainder will arise from loss and excess 0 profits credit carrybacks , recomputed amortization on war plants , and 429 relief from 413 excess profits tax . This category of expenditures is thus losing gradually its \" aftermath - 150 0 war \" character , and by the succeeding year will reflect almost entirely the normal operation 150 loss carry - backs and current tax collection . 0 0 AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS The agricultural programs contemplated for the fiscal year 1947 are those which are essential for the provision of 51 adequate supply 150 food and other agricultural commodities with a fair return 470 American 826 . To 1136 718 objectives 0 expenditures by the Department of Agriculture estimated at 784 240 dollars 390 general and 429 accounts will be required in the fiscal year 1947 . This compares 1218 estimated expenditures of 676 million dollars 60 1946 . These figures exclude expenditures by the Department of Agriculture on account of lend - 341 , the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration , and 683 war expenditures . The expenditure for the fiscal year 1947 is 572 of 553 million dollars for \" aids to agriculture ,\" 35 million dollars for general public works , and 0 million dollars for other 829 of the Department . Net outlays for the price stabilization , price support , and other 894 of the Commodity Credit Corporation are expected to increase from about 750 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946 to 479 1 , 0 240 dollars in 1947 . Cash advances made 120 loans by the 321 Security Administration and the Rural Electrification 1546 are expected to amount to 0 million dollars 60 the fiscal year 1946 and 351 million dollars 60 1947 ; 55 after receipts from principal and interest are taken into account , net loan expenditures of these two agencies will amount to 120 and 209 million dollars in the two fiscal years . To provide for the expenditures from general and special accounts , I recommend for the fiscal 216 1947 1552 of 0 million dollars ( including the existing permanent appropriation of an amount equal to 30 percent of estimated annual customs receipts 0 and a reappropriation of 88 million dollars of prior - year balances from customs 1003 . In addition there is 1 recommended authorization of 367 . 5 million dollars for borrowing from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for the loan programs 150 the Farm Security Administration and the Rural Electrification Administration . It is expected that 413 1186 of the Commodity 622 Corporation will be financed 273 the coming year through the 500 million dollars 150 lend - lease funds which the Congress has earmarked 350 price support purposes , a supplemental appropriation to restore impaired capital of the Corporation , 55 the borrowing authority of the Corporation . Some detailed recommendations follow for major agricultural programs . Conservation 55 use of 85 .-- I 41 recommending that 0 million dollars 7 appropriated for \" 1165 and use of agricultural land resources \"- the so - called AAA program - for the fiscal 216 1947 , compared with 356 million 635 in the current year . This reduction of 86 million dollars is 60 large part accounted for by elimination of the wartime flax production incentive project and other nonrecurring items ; the proposed reduction in normal activities is less than 33 million dollars . For 413 past several years , this program has 1142 largely 150 payments to farmers for 735 of fertilizer 55 other approved soil management practices . I am convinced 809 826 generally are now fully alert 470 the benefits , both immediate and long 0 term , which they derive 390 the practices encouraged by this program 0 I believe , therefore , that this subsidization should continue to be reduced . Rural electrification .-- It is proposed that the loan authorization for the Rural Electrification Administration for the fiscal year 0 he increased from 200 million dollars to 250 million dollars . During the 1001 period , REA was limited by the scarcity 150 materials and 1246 . But 809 situation is rapidly changing , and the 206 594 , which was materially stepped 86 for the fiscal year 1946 , can he increased still more . 410 is my belief that 1 feasible and 728 437 electrification program should be carried forward as rapidly as possible . This will involve total loans of approximately 1 , 800 million dollars over the next 10 years , much of which will be repaid during 809 period . Other programs .-- It is recommended that the continuing forest land - 960 program be resumed at the rate of 3 million dollars annually , which is about the minimum 606 at which this program 54 be economically carried on . The lands involved 60 718 program can contribute fully to the national welfare only when brought 530 the national forest system for protection and development . 317 894 301 those of the Farm Security Administration and the 321 622 Administration are estimated to be continued during the fiscal year 1947 at about the same level as in the fiscal year 1946 . Recent 534 12 the Congress has permitted some 626 of the school 0 lunch program . I hope it will be continued and expanded . The budgets 150 the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation will be transmitted in the spring under the terms of the Government Corporation Control Act . 4 . 2232 Transportation is one of the major fields for both public and private investment . Our facilities for 2232 and communication must be 1314 improved to serve better the convenience of the public and 470 facilitate 413 sound growth and development of the whole economy . Federal capital outlays for transportation 849 are expected to approximate 519 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947 . State and local governments may spend 400 million dollars . Private investment , over half of it by railways 0 may approach 1 0 150 million dollars . The Congress has already taken steps for the resumption of work on improvement of rivers and harbors and on the construction of new Federal - aid highways . Much needed work on airports can begin when the 931 enacts legislation now in conference 1267 the two Houses . 413 Federal expenditure estimates for the fiscal year 1947 include 53 million dollars for new construction in rivers , harbors , and the Panama Canal and 291 million dollars 350 highways and grade - 936 elimination , assuming that the States expend some 275 million dollars on the Federal 0 aid system . Additional 1125 for highways totaling 36 million dollars are anticipated by the Forest Service , National Park 529 , and the Territory of Alaska . Civil airways and airports will involve expenditures of 35 million dollars under existing authority . Additional Federal expenditures exceeding 20 million dollars ( to be matched by States and 955 ) may be made during 413 fiscal year 1947 under the airport legislation now in 471 between the two Houses of the Congress . 413 United States now controls almost two - thirds of the world \\' s merchant shipping , most of it 829 - 929 , compared with little more than 125 0 seventh of the 1104 \\' 300 tonnage in 1939 . This places a heavy responsibility upon the Nation to provide 350 speedy and efficient world commerce as a 1271 to general 251 recovery . The estimates for the United States Maritime Commission and War Shipping Administration provide 350 the transition of shipping operation from a war to a peace basis 0 the sale , chartering , 270 lay - up of 57 of the war 0 built 520 ; and for a program 150 398 construction of some 84 240 dollars in the fiscal year 1947 to round out the merchant fleet for peacetime use . 325 aids , subsidies , 55 regulatory controls for transportation should follow the general principle of benefiting 413 national economy as a whole . They 418 seek to improve the 2232 system and increase its efficiency with 1004 lower rates and superior 529 . Differential treatment which 852 one type of transportation to 413 1114 of another should be avoided save when it is demonstrated clearly to be in the public interest . 5 . RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT Total capital outlays for resource development 206 estimated at 0 million dollars in the fiscal year 0 as compared with 452 million dollars 60 1946 . These include capital expenditures by the Rural Electrification Administration and expenditures for resource development by other organizational units 60 the Department of 864 which 206 also mentioned above under \" agricultural programs .\" The reclamation and flood 823 projects which I 41 recommending for the fiscal year 1947 will involve capital outlays 150 approximately 0 million dollars 301 compared with 245 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946 . These expenditures cover programs of 413 Corps of Engineers , the Bureau of 810 , the Bureau of Indian Affairs 0 the Department of Agriculture , and the International Boundary and Water Commission , United States and Mexico . A number of these projects are multiple 0 purpose projects , 433 not only for reclamation and irrigation of barren land and flood 823 , but also 350 the production of power needed for industrial development of the areas 0 Expenditures for power transmission 55 distribution facilities by the Bonneville 1155 Administration are expected to increase from 12 million dollars in 413 fiscal year 1946 to 15 million dollars in the next fiscal year . In addition , the Southwestern Power Administration will undertake a new program involving expenditures of about 16 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947 0 The Rural Electrification Administration will require expenditures during the current fiscal year estimated at 156 million dollars ; in the fiscal year 1947 , at 0 million dollars . The TVA program includes completion of major 601 - purpose 1068 - navigation , flood control , and power facilities -- and additions to chemical plants and related facilities . Expenditures for these capital improvement programs are estimated 401 30 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946 and 39 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947 . 1125 for construction of roads and other developmental works in the national forests , parks , and other public lands , and for 525 817 for fish and wildlife 695 will increase 390 below 9 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946 to 24 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947 . 6 . SOCIAL SECURITY AND HEALTH Benefit payments out of the Old - Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund during 1947 are estimated at 0 million dollars , while withdrawals by the States from the Unemployment Trust Fund for 1079 886 are expected 470 total 0 billion dollars . These 1622 are financed out 150 Social Security contributions . The appropriations 390 general and 429 833 for the social security program , which cover Federal administrative expenses and grants to States for assistance programs , are estimated at 593 240 dollars for the fiscal year 1947 0 an 574 of 57 million 635 281 the current year . The increase anticipates 814 administrative workload and higher grants to match 632 1106 payments . 413 social security program does not include all the Federal health 829 under 838 legislation 0 For the other health services classified under 294 government and national defense , appropriations 206 estimated at 102 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947 . Some expansion in peacetime medical research and other programs of the Public 452 Service is provided for in the appropriation estimates for 718 purposes 964 approximately 87 240 dollars for 413 fiscal year 1947 which are submitted under provisions 150 existing law . Part of this will be provided through the social security appropriations , 413 remainder through other appropriations 0 About 28 240 dollars is recommended 350 1116 care and 452 829 for children under existing law , mainly 265 the emergency provision 350 the wives and infants of servicemen . 853 we should avoid duplication of maternity and child health services which 870 be provided through the proposed general system of prepaid medical care , 909 is needed to supplement 317 services . For medical education , I have recommended legislation 765 grants 0 60 - 15 to 131 and nonprofit institutions . The existing sources of support for medical 781 require supplementation to sustain the expansion that 310 needed . Hospitals , sanitation works , and additional facilities at medical schools will be required for an adequate national health program . Legislation is now 202 60 the Congress to authorize grants for the construction of hospitals and health centers and grants and loans for water - pollution control . I hope the Congress will act favorably on generous authorizing legislation . 7 0 RESEARCH AND EDUCATION The Budget provides 350 continuation and desirable expansion of the research activities that 206 carried on throughout the Federal establishment and through previously authorized grants to the States . 580 appropriations will he 530 350 the proposed central Federal research agency which I recommended last September 6 . That agency will coordinate existing research activities and administer funds for new research activities wherever 423 are needed 0 it 870 not itself conduct research . The plan contemplates expenditures through the new research agency of approximately 40 240 dollars for the first year . These amounts are small in relation to the important 1271 they 54 make to 413 national 178 , the welfare of our people 0 and the common defense . Expenditures must be limited for the time being by the capacity of 722 agencies to 66 wise use of funds 0 The maintenance of our position as a nation , however , will require more 744 on research expenditures in the future than in the past . 580 1125 will require a significant share of the national income 60 the fiscal year 1947 . State , local , and private expenditures for the current support of 746 , secondary , and higher education are expected to be 1540 above 3 billion dollars in that year 0 These non - Federal expenditures will be supplemented 12 Federal expenditures estimated at 625 million dollars in the present Budget . Of this 567 , the estimate for veterans \\' education , as previously mentioned , is 535 million 635 . 683 amounts include 21 million dollars for the support of vocational education in public schools 0 5 240 dollars for the land - 654 colleges , 50 240 635 for the present school lunch and milk program , 1 million dollars for 413 Office of Education , and approximately 13 million dollars for various other items . In 821 of the major policy issues which are still 265 study by the Congress and the Administration , no specific amount has been determined for the 325 954 , 717 recommended in 718 Message , which would assist the States generally 60 assuring more nearly equal opportunities for a good education . Notwithstanding the urgent need for additional school and college buildings , careful planning will be required 350 413 expenditures to be 50 under 413 proposed legislation to aid the 1406 in providing educational 849 . A major share of the 954 for the 990 year would he for surveys and plans . 8 . INTERNATIONAL - FINANCIAL 894 I have already outlined the 277 objectives of our 418 economic policy . 60 413 present 838 I shall indicate the Federal outlays which the execution of these programs may require in the fiscal years 1946 and 1947 0 ( a ) On the termination of lend - lease 0 the lend - lease countries 1010 required to pay for goods in the lend - lease pipe line either in cash or by borrowing from the United 1406 or by supplying goods 55 services to the United States . Credits for this purpose have already 62 extended to the Soviet Union , France , the Netherlands , and Belgium amounting to 675 million dollars . The settlement credit 150 650 million dollars to the United Kingdom includes 51 amount preliminarily 159 at 118 240 dollars which represents the excess of purchases 12 the United Kingdom from the pipe line 281 goods and services supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States since VJ - day and the balance of various claims 12 one government against the other 0 Credits are 401 being negotiated with 89 - lease 1044 to finance the disposition of lend - 341 inventories and installations and property declared 470 be surplus . For instance , 532 million dollars of the settlement credit to the United Kingdom is for this purpose . These credits will involve no new expenditures by 718 Government , since they merely provide 350 deferred repayment by other governments for goods and services which have been 203 from war appropriations . 0 b ) Expenditures 390 the appropriations to United 881 Relief and Rehabilitation Administration , which were discussed under war expenditures above , are estimated to be 1 0 3 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1946 and 0 . 2 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1947 . ( c ) To assist other countries in the restoration of their economies the 815 - Import Bank has 251 negotiated loans in the fiscal year 1946 amounting 60 total to about 1 , 010 million dollars 55 an additional 0 240 dollars will probably be committed shortly . The Bank is also 717 loans to carry out its original purpose of directly 263 the foreign 610 of the United States . In this connection the Bank has established a fund of too million dollars 470 finance the export of cotton from the 475 States . The Export - Import Bank has thus loaned or committed approximately 1 , 300 million 635 during 413 current fiscal year and it is expected that demands on its 1089 will increase in the last 0 months of the fiscal year 1946 . Requests 350 loans are constantly being received 12 the Bank from countries desiring to secure goods and services in 718 country for the reconstruction or development of their economies . On July 31 , 1945 , the 152 authority of 413 Export - Import 73 was increased to a total of 3 , 500 million dollars . I anticipate 809 during the period covered by this 0 Budget the Bank will reach this limit . The bulk of the expenditures from the loans already 663 will fall in the fiscal year 1946 853 the 58 of the expenditures from loans yet to be negotiated will 141 in the 424 year 1947 . In view of the urgent need for the Bank \\' s credit 0 I may find it 874 to request a further increase 60 its lending authority at a later date . ( d ) The proposed line of 622 150 0 0 750 240 dollars to the United Kingdom will be available up to the 59 of 1951 and will be used to assist the United Kingdom in financing the 512 in its balance of payments during the transition period . The rate at which the United 197 will 1005 on the credit will depend 120 the 715 with which it can reconvert its economy and adapt its trade to the postwar world . The anticipated rate of expenditure is likely 470 be 735 during the next 2 years . ( e ) Since the Bretton Woods Agreements have now been approved by the required number of countries , both the International 776 Fund and 413 International Bank for Reconstruction and Development will commence 1186 during 1946 . The organization of 718 2006 will undoubtedly take some time , and 410 is unlikely that their operations will 217 61 appreciable scale before the beginning of the 424 year 1947 . 150 the 2 , 750 million 635 530 for the Fund , 400 , Soo million dollars will be provided in cash or notes from the exchange 1291 fund established under the Gold Reserve Act of 0 934 . 413 remaining 950 million 635 will be paid initially in the form of non - interest - bearing notes issued by the Secretary of the 1122 . It is not 964 that the Fund 870 require in cash any of the 950 million dollars during the fiscal years 1946 and 1947 . Consequently , no cash withdrawals from the Treasury will be required in connection with the Fund in these years . The 1431 to 413 Bank 867 to 3 , 175 240 dollars . Of this total 0 2 743 must be paid immediately and the Bank is required to call a 899 8 percent of the subscription during its first year of operations . The balance of the subscription is 129 when required by the Bank either for direct 152 or to make good its guarantees . It is likely that the United States will be required to pay 875 if any more than the initial 10 percent before the end of the fiscal year 1947 . I anticipate that net expenditures of the Export - Import 73 and expenditures arising from the British credit and the Bretton Woods Agreements will amount to 2 , 0 240 dollars , including the noncash item of 950 million dollars 350 the Fund , 60 the fiscal year 1946 , and 2 , 754 million dollars in the fiscal 216 1947 . 0 . GENERAL GOVERNMENT The 1782 of the Government , in both domestic and international affairs , 20 increased greatly in the past decade . Consequently , the Government is larger than it was before the war , and its general operating costs are higher . We cannot shrink the Government to prewar dimensions unless we slough off these new 1782 -- and we cannot do that without paying an excessive price in terms of 276 national welfare . We can , however , enhance its operating efficiency through improved organization . 10 553 to make such improvements under 413 authority of the Reorganization Act of 1945 . The appropriations which 10 am recommending for general government for the fiscal year 1947 are 1 , 604 million dollars under existing legislation . This is an increase of 458 million dollars over the total 150 468 1552 for the current fiscal year , 408 a substantial part 150 this increase is due to the fact that 413 appropriations 350 the fiscal year 1946 were 50 prior to the general increase of employees \\' salaries last July 1 , for which allowance is made in the anticipated supplemental appropriations for 1946 . 413 recommended total for 1947 for general government , like the estimates for national defense and other specific programs , does not 931 for the further salary increases for Government employees which , I hope , will be authorized by pending legislation , but the tentative lump - sum estimates under proposed legislation contemplate that such salary increases will be effective almost at once . Expenditures for general government in the fiscal year 1947 are 562 to continue the slowly rising trend which began in 1943 . This category includes a 609 632 of items 0 not merely the 299 costs of 413 Government . It includes all the expenditures of the Cabinet departments , other than 350 national defense , aids to agriculture , 294 public works , and 413 social security program . It includes also expenditures of the legislative branch 0 the Judiciary ; 55 101 of the independent agencies of the executive branch . Consequently , 413 estimated increase in 1947 in the total of general government expenditures reflects a variety 150 influences . Now included 60 general 829 are certain activities formerly classified 265 national defense . 415 of these , such as certain functions of the 595 Foreign 251 Administration and the War Manpower Commission , are 770 needed 273 the period of reconversion ; others are in 413 process of liquidation . A 885 wartime activities , for example , the international information and foreign intelligence services and some of the wartime programs for controlling disease 55 crime , have 125 part of our regular 829 establishment . 1125 350 these former wartime functions explain about 0 percent of the increase in expenditures for general government . Other increases are 350 civil 1046 promotion , the business and manufacturing censuses , and other 209 business services of the Department of 366 which have been referred to above ; the Forest and Soil Conservation Services and other activities of the Department of Agriculture ; certain conservation activities of 413 1185 of the Interior 0 and the collection of internal revenue in the Treasury Department . The necessity for reestablishing postal services curtailed during the war and advances in the rates of pay for postal 545 have increased substantially the 1165 expenditures for postal 529 for both the current and the next fiscal year 0 It is not expected that this increase will cause expenditures 470 exceed postal revenues in either 216 , although an excess of expenditures may occur 60 the fiscal year 1947 if salaries are increased further . Expenditures for our share of the administrative budgets of the United Nations and other permanent international bodes will increase 629 in the fiscal year 1947 , yet 870 remain a small part of our total Budget . The budget 350 the United Nations has not yet been determined ; an estimate for our contribution will be submitted later . Our contributions to the Food and Agriculture Organization , the International Labor 248 , 413 Pan American Union , 55 other similar international agencies will aggregate about 3 million dollars for the 424 year 1947 . The administrative 805 of the 1277 Monetary Fund and the 1277 Bank will be 445 from their general funds . 805 have won a great war - we , 413 nations of plain 270 who hate war . In the test of that war we found a strength of unity that brought us through - a strength that crushed the power of those who 787 by force to deny our faith in 413 dignity of man . During this 641 the voices of disunity among us were 795 or were subdued to an occasional whine that warned us that 423 were still among us 0 Those voices are beginning to cry aloud again . 805 746 learn constantly to turn deaf ears to them . 423 are voices which foster fear and suspicion 55 intolerance and hate . Thy 330 to destroy our harmony , our understanding of each other 0 our American tradition of \" live and let live .\" They have become 318 again 0 trying to set race against race 0 creed 765 creed , farmer against city dweller , worker against employer , people against their own governments . They seek only 470 do us mischief . They must not prevail . It should be 847 for any man 470 contemplate without a sense of personal humility the tremendous events of the 12 868 since the last annual Message , the 609 tasks that confront us , 413 new and huge problems 150 the 176 months and years . Yet these very things justify the deepest confidence in the future of 718 Nation 150 free men and women . The plain people of this country 210 the courage and 413 1366 , the self - discipline , and the 483 respect to fight and to win 0 with the help of our allies , under God 0 10 doubt if 413 tasks of the future are more difficult . But if they are , 463 I say that our strength and our 987 and our understanding will be equal to those tasks .'"
